<p class="section">We have now followed the personal history of David Hume through nearly
twenty years of authorship. We have seen him approach the tribunal of
public opinion with the strongest internal assurance of success, and in
a form so different from that of his predecessors, as a high reliance on
his own powers could alone have prompted. Baffled in the first, and in
the second, and in the third attempt, he still persevered; and while the
coldness of each reception showed him that his last effort had proved a
failure, it never extinguished the fire of literary ardour which he felt
burning within him, or quenched the hope, that it would one day blaze
forth before the world. It is only towards the termination of this long
period of laborious authorship that we find the <!-- Page 2 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_2" id="Page_v2_2">[2]</a></span>philosopher's early
visions of intellectual greatness beginning to be fulfilled. At the
period at which we have now arrived, his name was famous over Europe. It
was a fame that, once spread abroad, was not soon to die; for those to
whom his name was first made known in his new popular work, speedily
discovered that, in his earliest neglected effort, he had laid the
foundation of a still surer claim on their admiration, and justified the
sagacity with which, in the pride and strength of youthful genius, he
had thrown its first fruits before the world unaided and unadvised.</p>

<p>The year 1756 seems to have been in a great measure devoted by Hume to
the printing of the second volume of his History, to which the following
letters to Millar refer. A great part of the correspondence with this
sagacious publisher relates to minute business arrangements. It is
presumed, that the reader may wish to see some specimens of the manner
in which Hume transacted such matters, but that he will not care to have
the whole of the arrangements between the author and publisher laid
before him. A few specimens of the business part of the letters are
accordingly selected, while those portions which have any general
interest, literary, philosophical, or political, are given in full. The
reader will see, perhaps, with some surprise, that he was very anxious
to subject his style to the critical eye of Mallet. We shall hereafter
have to disclose some curious features of his literary intercourse with
this extraordinary person.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 22d September, 1756.</p>

<p>"Mr. Strahan, in a few days, will have finished the printing
this volume; and I hope you will find leisure, <!-- Page 3 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_3" id="Page_v2_3">[3]</a></span>before the
hurry of winter, to peruse it, and to write me your remarks on
it. I fancy you will publish about the middle of November. I
must desire you to take the trouble of distributing a few
copies to my friends in London, and of sending me a few copies
here. The whole will be fifteen copies.</p>

<p>"Notwithstanding Mr. Mallet's impertinence in not answering my
letter, (for it deserves no better a name,) if you can engage
him from yourself to mark on the perusal such slips of
language as he thinks I have fallen into in this volume, it
will be a great obligation to me: I mean that I shall lie
under an obligation to you; for I would not willingly owe any
to him. I am, dear sir, your most humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_3:1_2" id="FNanchor_3:1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_3:1_2" class="fnanchor">[3:1]</a></p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 4th December, 1756.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have two of yours before me, and should have
answered them sooner, had not Mr. Dalrymple told me that he
would come to a resolution, in a few days, about the method of
printing his volume. As soon as he does so, I shall write you.</p>

<p>"I am certainly very well satisfied with your sale, which I
hope continues. Lord Lyttelton's objection is not well
grounded; I have not contradicted that story betwixt
Shaftesbury and Clifford: I have only omitted it. It stands
only on Burnet's authority, who is very careless and
inaccurate. I believe I could convince both you and him that
it was without foundation. I am very glad that Mr. Mallet has
marked those expressions which appeared Scotticisms. You could
not do me a greater pleasure than to procure me a list of
them. I beg of you to employ all your interest with him to
that purpose. I am very anxious to see them soon, that I may
examine them at leisure, and <!-- Page 4 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_4" id="Page_v2_4">[4]</a></span>correct them in all my writings.
A very little time would suffice for him to take down the page
and the line and the expression. If counting the line were too
troublesome, he would oblige me by only marking the page and
the expression; I would easily find it.</p>

<p>"I had a conversation, yesterday, with Messrs. Kincaid and
Donaldson, when I made them a proposal, which, I hope, will be
for both your advantage. They told me that you had only about
four hundred complete sets of my philosophical writings. I am
extremely desirous to have these four volumes, with that which
you will publish this winter, brought into a quarto volume.
They said that the small size was rather more proper for their
sale; and, therefore, they would gladly take, at present, two
hundred sets of the four volumes, to be paid for by so many of
their shares in the quarto edition as would be an equivalent;
that is, if the quarto volume were sold at the same price with
the four volumes, then set for set: if at more, then such
allowance to be made as, upon calculation, would appear to be
an equivalent. If the History meet with success, it will
certainly quicken the sale of the philosophical writings; and
the taking two hundred sets from you, leaves you so small a
number on hand, as gives you a certain prospect of coming soon
to a new edition. Though some odd copies of particular volumes
remain on hand, there is no great matter, as they may be
disposed of with a small discount. If you agree to this
proposal, they empowered me to desire you to put the two
hundred copies on board a ship with the first occasion, and to
write them a letter, by which they may be sure that there is
no mistake in the conditions. The bringing these scattered
pieces into one volume will, of itself, quicken the sale; and
every new edition has naturally that effect.</p>

<p><!-- Page 5 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_5" id="Page_v2_5">[5]</a></span>"I again recommend to you, very earnestly, the procuring me
that favour from Mr. Mallet. It is not possible that he can
refuse you. I wish I had desired you to ask the same favour of
Mr. Reid, to whom please to make my compliments. I am, dear
sir, your most obedient servant."<a name="FNanchor_5:1_3" id="FNanchor_5:1_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:1_3" class="fnanchor">[5:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The second volume of the History, bringing down the narrative to the
Revolution, was published in 1756. "This performance," says Hume in his
"own life," alluding to the previous volume, "happened to give less
displeasure to the Whigs, and was better received. It not only rose
itself, but helped to buoy up its unfortunate brother."</p>

<p>The manner in which he had characterized the different religious bodies,
whose conduct he had to describe, gave offence to many readers, and was
afterwards matter of regret to himself. The toleration which forbids us
to punish our neighbour on account of his creed, he had fully learned.
That still higher toleration, which forbids us to treat our neighbour's
religious creed with disrespect, he had not yet acquired. He always
speaks of the extreme Independents and Presbyterians as enthusiasts.
With this term, not in itself opprobrious, because, though it implies
excess, it does not imply the excess of a bad quality, he, on some
occasions, associates the word fanaticism, and other expressions having
a like sarcastic, or at least slighting tendency. To the Roman Catholic
religion he was still less respectful, generally speaking of it as "the
Catholic superstition."<a name="FNanchor_5:2_4" id="FNanchor_5:2_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_5:2_4" class="fnanchor">[5:2]</a> <!-- Page 6 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_6" id="Page_v2_6">[6]</a></span>In his "Natural History of
Religion," published in 1757, he used the same offensive expressions,
and spoke of the ceremonies and essential doctrines of the church of
Rome, in a tone which no sincere member of that church can encounter
without painful feelings. In this respect he certainly did not act up to
the character of a true philosopher, though his expressions are no doubt
in harmony with the general tone of his mind. He certainly had no wish
to insult any man's creed, but he never dreamed that, among his readers,
there might be some who sympathized deeply with the catholic spirit of
the gothic ages, or with the independent temper of the covenanters. One
whose mind revolted so nervously against whatever was not stamped with
the character of profound philosophy, or of brilliant intellect, could
see nothing to admire in the adaptation of the catholic system to the
dark ages in which it flourished; and would have little respect for such
achievements as it gained in the war with barbarous minds and brutal
passions.<a name="FNanchor_6:1_5" id="FNanchor_6:1_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_6:1_5" class="fnanchor">[6:1]</a></p>

<p>In Scotland, the Episcopal Church was at that time barely tolerated; and
many an outcry against <!-- Page 7 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_7" id="Page_v2_7">[7]</a></span>this toleration, as one of the sins of the time,
made its adherents daily fear that their freedom of conscience <!-- Page 8 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_8" id="Page_v2_8">[8]</a></span>might be
made still more narrow. For the Roman Catholics there was no toleration
in the proper acceptation of the term. Had their priesthood <!-- Page 9 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_9" id="Page_v2_9">[9]</a></span>mingled in
the ordinary society of Edinburgh, and had Hume become acquainted with
them as he afterwards was with the clergy of France, he would perhaps
have blushed to write as he did, of the creed of learned and
accomplished men. In his subsequent editions, he carefully cleansed his
History of these offensive expressions, substituting in general the word
"creed" or "religion," instead of superstition.</p>

<p>The coincidence of his metaphysical opinions, with those of a
considerable portion of the Presbyterians, has already been noticed; and
his desire to strip religion of all forms and symbols, would seem to
point out the Presbyterian system as that with which he should naturally
have had the greatest sympathy. But he disliked enthusiasm or zeal,
whatever were the opinions of the zealots; and therefore he invariably
marks with censure the extreme views of that religious party. In the
English church, on the other hand, he met with a larger proportion of
learned, accomplished, and gentlemanlike men. Among persons, too, many
of whom were tempted to assume the sacerdotal character by its
emoluments, not by its duties, he found a tolerable portion of that
philosophical indifference, which it is to be feared he looked upon as
no blemish in a clergyman's character. In the Church of England, his
sympathies were thus with the insincere.<a name="FNanchor_9:1_6" id="FNanchor_9:1_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_9:1_6" class="fnanchor">[9:1]</a> Where <!-- Page 10 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_10" id="Page_v2_10">[10]</a></span>there was sincere
belief, but not to the extent of enthusiasm, the clergy of the Church of
Scotland would have the largest share of his confidence. Accordingly, we
find that he had formed a warm intimacy with many of the members of the
"moderate" party in that church. His own good taste and sense of
colloquial politeness, would suggest to him the propriety of avoiding,
whether in correspondence or conversation, all forms of expression or
enunciations of opinion, such as it would be unbecoming in a clergyman
to hear without reproving. On the other hand, his correspondence with
the clergy bears traces of his having made it part of the understanding
on which their intercourse was to be based, that they were not to make
him a subject for the exercise of their calling; and that they were to
abstain from all efforts of conversion, and all discussion of religious
subjects. Hence, although there are many observations on church politics
in his correspondence with his reverend friends, religion is a matter
never mentioned.</p>

<p>Before he published his second volume, Hume felt conscious of the
impropriety of the tone he had adopted in the first, towards religious
creeds. In a letter to Dr. Clephane, he says,&mdash;"I am convinced that
whatever I have said of religion should have received some more
softenings. There is no passage in the History <!-- Page 11 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_11" id="Page_v2_11">[11]</a></span>which strikes in the
least at revelation. But as I run over all the sects successively, and
speak of each of them with some mark of disregard, the reader, putting
the whole together, concludes that I am of no sect; which to him will
appear the same thing as the being of no religion. With regard to
politics and the character of princes and great men, I think I am very
moderate. My views of <em>things</em> are more conformable to Whig principles;
my representations of <em>persons</em> to Tory prejudices. Nothing can so much
prove that men commonly regard more persons than things, as to find that
I am commonly numbered among the Tories."<a name="FNanchor_11:1_7" id="FNanchor_11:1_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_11:1_7" class="fnanchor">[11:1]</a></p>

<p>The following paper is evidently a draft of a preface, which, in the
consciousness that some apology was called for in connexion with this
subject, he intended to prefix to the second volume. He afterwards
published a great part of the substance of it in a note towards the end
of the volume: but there is sufficient difference in the contents of the
two papers to make the following a distinct object of interest.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center">PREFACE.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>It ought to be no matter of offence, that in this volume, as
well as in the foregoing, the mischiefs which arise from the
abuses of religion are so often mentioned, while so little in
comparison is said of the salutary consequences which result
from true and genuine piety. The proper office of religion is
to reform men's lives, to purify their hearts, to enforce all
moral duties, and to secure obedience to the laws and civil
magistrate. While it pursues these useful purposes, its
operations, though infinitely valuable, are secret and silent,
and seldom come under the cognisance of history. That
adulterate species of it alone, which inflames faction,
animates sedition, and prompts rebellion, distinguishes itself
in the <!-- Page 12 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_12" id="Page_v2_12">[12]</a></span>open theatre of the world. Those, therefore, who
attempt to draw inferences disadvantageous to religion from
the abuses of it mentioned by historians, proceed upon a very
gross, and a very obvious fallacy; for, besides that every
thing is liable to abuse, and the best things the most so, the
beneficent influence of religion is not to be sought for in
history. That principle is always the more pure and genuine,
the less figure it makes in the annals of war, politics,
intrigues, and revolutions, quarrels, and convulsions; which
it is the business of an historian to record and transmit to
posterity.</p>

<p>It ought as little to be matter of offence, that no religious
sect is mentioned in this work without being exposed sometimes
to some note of blame and disapprobation. The frailties of our
nature mingle themselves with every thing in which we are
employed, and no human institutions will ever reach
perfection, the idea of an infinite mind. The author of the
universe seems at first sight to require a worship absolutely
pure, simple, unadorned, without rites, institutions,
ceremonies; even without temples, priests, or verbal prayer
and supplication. Yet has this species of devotion been often
found to degenerate into the most dangerous fanaticism. When
we have recourse to the aid of the senses and imagination, in
order to adapt our religion in some degree to human infirmity,
it is very difficult, and almost impossible, to prevent
altogether the intrusion of superstition, or keep men from
laying too great stress on the ceremonial and ornamental parts
of their worship. Of all the sects into which Christians have
been divided, the Church of England seems to have chosen the
most happy medium; yet it will undoubtedly be allowed, that
during the age of which these volumes treat, there was a
tincture of superstition in the partisans of the hierarchy, as
well as a strong mixture of enthusiasm in their antagonists.
But it is the nature of the latter principle soon to evaporate
and decay. A spirit of moderation usually succeeds in a little
to the fervours of zeal; and it must be acknowledged, to the
honour of the present Presbyterians, Independents, and other
sectaries of this island, that they resemble in little more
than in name their predecessors, who flourished during the
civil wars, and who were the authors of such disorders. It
would appear ridiculous in the eyes of <!-- Page 13 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_13" id="Page_v2_13">[13]</a></span>the judicious part of
mankind, to pretend that even the first reformers, in most
countries of Europe, did not carry matters to a most violent
extreme, and were not on many occasions liable to the
imputation of fanaticism. Not to mention that uncharitable
spirit which accompanies zealots of all kinds, and which led
the early reformers, almost universally, to inflict upon the
Catholics, and on all who differed from them, the same rigours
of which they themselves so loudly complained.</p>

<p>These hints, however obvious, the author thought proper to
suggest, with regard to the free and impartial manner in which
he has treated religious controversy. As to the civil and
political part of his performance, he scorns to suggest any
apology, where he thinks himself entitled to approbation. To
be above the temptation of interest is a species of virtue,
which we do not find by experience to be very common; but to
neglect at the same time all popular and vulgar applause, is
an enterprise much more rare and arduous. Whoever, in a
factious nation, pays court to neither party, must expect that
justice will be done him by time only, perhaps only by a
distant posterity.<a name="FNanchor_13:1_8" id="FNanchor_13:1_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:1_8" class="fnanchor">[13:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The "Natural History of Religion" above referred to, remarkable even
among its author's other works, for the breadth of its research, and its
apt union of philosophy with historical detail, was published in 1757,
along with three other essays;<a name="FNanchor_13:2_9" id="FNanchor_13:2_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_13:2_9" class="fnanchor">[13:2]</a> and a curious incident connected
with this publication has now to be revealed. In 1783, a work was
published in London, called "Essays on Suicide and the Immortality of
the Soul, ascribed to the late David Hume, Esq., never before published;
with remarks, intended as an antidote to the poison contained in these
<!-- Page 14 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_14" id="Page_v2_14">[14]</a></span>performances, by the Editor." The editor and his antidote are now both
forgotten: but the style of Hume and his method of thinking were at once
recognised in these essays, and they have been incorporated with the
general edition of his works. If any doubt attached to the authorship,
it would be cleared up by some allusions in his subsequent
correspondence, where we shall find him naturally expressing alarm at
the circumstance of Wilkes having, through the negligence of Millar, had
possession of a copy containing the two suppressed essays. Many copies,
indeed, of the first edition of the dissertations bear marks of having
been mutilated.<a name="FNanchor_14:1_10" id="FNanchor_14:1_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_14:1_10" class="fnanchor">[14:1]</a> That Hume wrote these essays, and intended to
publish them, is thus an incident in his life which ought not to be
passed over; but it is also part of his history, that he repented of the
act at the last available moment, and suppressed the publication.</p>

<p>That after the ghastly scene which he witnessed twenty years
earlier,<a name="FNanchor_14:2_11" id="FNanchor_14:2_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_14:2_11" class="fnanchor">[14:2]</a> he should have written on suicide with his usual
philosophical indifference, and contempt for the prevalent sentiments
and feelings of mankind, is a remarkable proof how little he was liable
to ordinary imaginative impressions; how completely he was free of
subjection to those</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line i5h">"lords of the visionary eye, whose lid</div>
    <div class="line">Once raised remains aghast, and will not fall."</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It may safely be pronounced, that had he widened the circle of his
utilitarian theory, and embraced <!-- Page 15 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_15" id="Page_v2_15">[15]</a></span>within it, as he might have done,
Hutcheson's theory of universal benevolence, he never would have
palliated self-slaughter. He looked at it only in relation to the person
who perpetrates the act. The utilitarian principle, however, should have
suggested to him the misery caused to surviving relatives by one such
deed, the horrible uncertainty that must pervade any society where it is
common; and he would have felt that no single life can be so dreadful a
burden to the owner as to justify him in causing such an amount of evil
to the rest of the world, as he would produce by casting it away. The
result of modern reading and inquiry into vital statistics, is to show
that the desire of longevity, which the author of our being has
implanted in all bosoms, is an adaptation to universal utility; because
it is from premature deaths, produced by violence or disease, that
communities are burdened with those unproductive members of society,
which in a healthy and long-lived community, receive domestic support
from the productive members.<a name="FNanchor_15:1_12" id="FNanchor_15:1_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_15:1_12" class="fnanchor">[15:1]</a></p>

<p>The reasonings of an enthusiast have generally more plausibility than
those of a philosopher who has gone astray from his own theory; for the
straying <!-- Page 16 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_16" id="Page_v2_16">[16]</a></span>philosopher speaks like one who has misgivings; while the
enthusiast never doubts that he is in the right, and urges his opinions
with a corresponding confidence and sincerity. Thus the justification of
suicide which Rousseau puts into a letter from St. Preux to Lord Edward
Bomston, is a far more attractive vindication than that which Hume had
intended to publish.</p>

<p>This was not the only suppression connected with the publication of the
Dissertations. As at first printed, they were preceded by an
affectionate and laudatory dedication to John Home. Before the edition
was published, this dedication was suppressed; because Hume thought it
might injure his friend, in the estimation of his brethren of the
church. Before the edition was sold, however, Hume desired the
dedication to be restored. This step was probably owing to Home having
intimated to him his design of resigning his charge as minister of
Athelstaneford, which he did in June, 1757. This not only removed the
objection to the dedication, but as it severed the dramatic martyr from
his professional brethren, it made him more dependant on the sympathy
and suffrages of other friends, and rendered Hume's testimony to his
merits more valuable.</p>

<p>He thus writes on this subject to Smith.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p><a name="FNanchor_16:1_13" id="FNanchor_16:1_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_16:1_13" class="fnanchor">[16:1]</a>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;The dedication to John Home, you have
probably seen; for I find it has been inserted in some of the
weekly papers, both here and in London. Some of my friends
thought it was indiscreet in me to make myself responsible to
the public, for the productions <!-- Page 17 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_17" id="Page_v2_17">[17]</a></span>of another. But the author
had lain under such singular and unaccountable obstructions in
his road to fame, that I thought it incumbent on his
wellwishers to go as much out of the common road to assist
him. I believe the composition of the dedication will be
esteemed very prudent, and not inelegant.</p>

<p>"I can now give you the satisfaction of hearing that the play,
though not near so well acted in Covent Garden as in this
place, is likely to be very successful. Its great intrinsic
merit breaks through all obstacles. When it shall be printed,
(which will be soon,) I am persuaded it will be esteemed the
best, and by French critics the only tragedy of our language!
This encouragement will no doubt engage the author to go on in
the same career. He meets with great countenance in London,
and, I hope, will soon be rendered independent in his fortune.</p>

<p>"Did you ever hear of such madness and folly as our clergy
have lately fallen into? For my part, I expect that the next
Assembly will very solemnly pronounce the sentence of
excommunication against me; but I do not apprehend it to be a
matter of any consequence; what do you think?</p>

<p>"I am somewhat idle at present, and somewhat undetermined as
to my next undertaking. Shall I go backwards or forwards in my
History? I think you used to tell me, that you approved more
of my going backwards. The other would be the more popular
subject; but I am afraid that I shall not find materials
sufficient to ascertain the truth&mdash;at least, without settling
in London, which, I own, I have some reluctance to. I am
settled here very much to my mind; and would not wish, at my
years, to change the place of my abode.</p>

<p>"I have just now received a copy of 'Douglas' <!-- Page 18 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_18" id="Page_v2_18">[18]</a></span>from London; it
will instantly be put in the press. I hope to be able to send
you a copy in the same parcel with the dedication."<a name="FNanchor_18:1_14" id="FNanchor_18:1_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_18:1_14" class="fnanchor">[18:1]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The dedication of my Dissertations to Mr.
Hume<a name="FNanchor_18:2_15" id="FNanchor_18:2_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_18:2_15" class="fnanchor">[18:2]</a> was shown to some of his friends here, men of very
good sense, who were seized with an apprehension that it would
hurt that party in the church, with which he had always been
connected, and would involve him, and them of consequence, in
the suspicion of infidelity. Neither he nor I were in the
least affected with their panic; but to satisfy them, we
agreed to stand by the arbitration of one person, of great
rank and of known prudence; and I promised them to write to
you to suspend the publication for one post, in case you
should have resolved to publish it presently. Next post you
shall be sure to hear from me; and if we be obliged to
suppress it, you'll be pleased to place the charges of print
and paper to my account. I indorse this day your two bills to
Mr. Alexander Cunningham. I am," &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>Early in 1757, Hume resigned his office of librarian of the Advocates'
Library. As a verbal intimation of his wishing to leave this situation
was not considered satisfactory, he favoured his learned employers with
the following laconic letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;A few days ago, I sent the Faculty a verbal
resignation; but as I am told that it is expected I <!-- Page 19 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_19" id="Page_v2_19">[19]</a></span>should

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">William Mure</span> <i>of Caldwell</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Mure</span>,&mdash;I hope you do not think yourself obliged, by
saying civil things, to make atonement for the too homely
truths, which you told me formerly. <!-- Page 20 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_20" id="Page_v2_20">[20]</a></span>I will not believe so. I
take for granted, that you are equally sincere in both: though
I must own that I think my first volume a great deal better
than the second. The subject admitted of more eloquence, and
of greater nicety of reasoning, and more acute distinctions.
The opposition, I may say the rage, with which it was received
by the public, I must confess, did not a little surprise me.
Whatever knowledge I pretend to in history, and human affairs,
I had not so bad an opinion of men as to expect that candour,
disinterestedness, and humanity, could entitle me to that
treatment. Yet such was my fate. After a long interval, I at
last collected so much courage, as to renew my application to
the second volume, though with infinite disgust and
reluctance; and I am sensible that, in many passages of it,
there are great signs of that disposition, and that my usual
fire does not every where appear. At other times, I excited
myself, and perhaps succeeded better.</p>

<p>"I leave you to judge whether your letter came in a very
seasonable time. I own that I had the weakness to be affected
by it, when I found that a person, whose judgment I very much
valued, could tell me, though I was not asking his
opinion&mdash;&mdash;But I will not proceed any farther. The matter gave
me uneasiness at the time, though without the least
resentment. <!-- Page 21 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_21" id="Page_v2_21">[21]</a></span>At present the uneasiness is gone; and all my
usual friendship, confirmed by years and long acquaintance,
still remains.</p>

<p>"Pray, whether do you pity or blame me most, with regard to
this dedication of my Dissertations to my friend, the poet? I
am sure I never executed any thing which was either more
elegant in the composition, or more generous in the intention;
yet such an alarm seized some fools here, (men of very good
sense, but fools in that particular,) that they assailed both
him and me with the utmost violence; and engaged us to change
our intention. I wrote to Millar to suppress that dedication;
two posts after, I retracted that order. Can any thing be more
unlucky than that, in the interval of these four days, he
should have opened his sale, and disposed of eight hundred
copies, without that dedication, whence, I imagined, my friend
would reap some advantage, and myself so much honour? I have
not been so heartily vexed at any accident of a long time.
However, I have insisted that the dedication shall still be
published.</p>

<p>"I am a little uncertain what work I shall next undertake; for
I do not care to be long idle. I think you seem to approve of
my going forward: and I am sensible that the subject is much
more interesting to us, and even will be so to posterity, than
any other I could choose: but can I hope that there are
materials for composing a just and sure history of it? I am
afraid not. However, I shall examine the matter. I fancy it
will be requisite for me to take a journey to London, and
settle there for some time, in order to gather such materials
as are not to be found in print. But, if I should go
backwards, and write the History of England from the accession
of Henry the Seventh, I might remain where I am; and I own to
you, at <!-- Page 22 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_22" id="Page_v2_22">[22]</a></span>my time of life, these changes of habitation are not
agreeable, even though the place be better to which one
removes.</p>

<p>"I am sorry my fair cousin does not find London so agreeable
as, perhaps, she expected. She must not judge by one winter.
It will improve against next winter, and appear still better
the winter after that. Please make my compliments to her, and
tell her that she must not be discouraged. By the by, Mrs.
Binnie tells me that she writes her a very different account
of matters, so that I find my cousin is a hypocrite.</p>

<p>"I shall make use of your criticisms, and wish there had been
more of them. That practice of doubling the genitive is
certainly very barbarous, and I carefully avoided it in the
first volume; but I find it so universal a practice, both in
writing and speaking, that I thought it better to comply with
it, and have even changed all the passages in the first
volume, in conformity to use. All languages contain solecisms
of that kind.</p>

<p>"Please make my compliments to Sir Harry Erskine, and tell him
that I have executed what I proposed. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_22:1_18" id="FNanchor_22:1_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_22:1_18" class="fnanchor">[22:1]</a></p>

<p>The following letter shows that he did not long remain idle, or
undecided in his historical projects:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 20th May, 1757.</p>

<p>"I have already begun, and am a little advanced in a third
volume of History. I do not preclude myself from the view of
going forward to the period after the Revolution; but, at
present, I begin with the <!-- Page 23 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_23" id="Page_v2_23">[23]</a></span>reign of Henry the Seventh. It is
properly at that period modern history commences. America was
discovered; commerce extended; the arts cultivated; printing
invented; religion reformed, and all the governments of Europe
almost changed. I wish, therefore, I had begun here at first.
I should have obviated many objections that were made to the
other volumes. I shall be considerably advanced in this volume
before I be in London.</p>

<p>"I come now to speak to you of an affair which gives me
uneasiness, and which I mention with reluctance. I am told
that one Dr. Brown has published a book in London, where there
is a note containing personal reflections on me, for which he
quotes a letter I wrote to you.<a name="FNanchor_23:1_19" id="FNanchor_23:1_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_23:1_19" class="fnanchor">[23:1]</a> What sort of behaviour
this is, to make use of a private letter, without the
permission of the person to whom <!-- Page 24 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_24" id="Page_v2_24">[24]</a></span>it was addressed, is easily
conceived; but how he came to see any of my letters, I cannot
imagine; nor what I wrote, that could give him any handle for
his calumny. All I can recollect of the matter is this, that
above two years ago, when Bailie Hamilton was in London, he
wrote me, that the stop in the sale of my History proceeded
from some strokes of irreligion, which had raised the cry of
the clergy against me. This gave me occasion to remark to you,
that the Bailie's complaint must have proceeded from his own
misconduct; that the cause he assigned could never have
produced that effect; that it was rather likely to increase
the sale, according to all past experience; that you had
offered (as I heard) a large sum for Bolingbroke's Works,
trusting to this consequence; and that the strokes complained
of were so few, and of such small importance, that, if any ill
effects could have been apprehended from them, they might
easily have been retrenched. As far as I can recollect, this
was the purport of my letter;<a name="FNanchor_24:1_20" id="FNanchor_24:1_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_24:1_20" class="fnanchor">[24:1]</a> but I must beg you, that
you would cause it to be transcribed, and send me a copy of
it, for I find by John Hume that you have it still by you. I
doubt not but I could easily refute Dr. Brown; but as I had
taken a resolution never to have the least altercation with
these fellows, I shall not readily be brought to pay any
attention to him; and I cannot but be displeased that your
inadvertence or indiscretion (for I cannot give it a better
name) should have brought me to this dilemma. I fancy Brown
will find it a difficult matter to persuade the public that I
do not speak my sentiments in every subject I handle, and that
I have any view to any interest whatsoever. I leave that to
him and his gang: for he is a flatterer, as I am <!-- Page 25 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_25" id="Page_v2_25">[25]</a></span>told, of
that low fellow, Warburton; and any thing so low as Warburton,
or his flatterers, I should certainly be ashamed to engage
with. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P.S. Since you are acquainted with Dr. Brown, I must beg of
you to read this letter to him; for it is probably, or indeed
certainly, all the answer I shall ever deign to give
him."<a name="FNanchor_25:1_21" id="FNanchor_25:1_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:1_21" class="fnanchor">[25:1]</a></p>

<p>The reader will feel interested in the sketch, by the pen of Hume, of an
eminent contemporary&mdash;his friend Wilkie&mdash;in the following letter.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 3d July, 1757.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;To show you that I am not such an affecter of
singularity as to entertain prejudices against ministers of
state,<a name="FNanchor_25:2_22" id="FNanchor_25:2_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_25:2_22" class="fnanchor">[25:2]</a> I am resolved to congratulate you on your return
to power, and to express my wishes, that, both for your sake
and the public's, your ministry, and that of your friends, may
be more durable than it was before. We even hope it will,
though the strange motley composition which it consists of,
gives us some apprehensions. However, we are glad to find,
from past experience, that you can neither rise nor fall,
without credit and reputation. You know that, according to the
whimsical way in this country, it is more difficult to rise
than fall with reputation.</p>

<p>"I suppose that, by this time, you have undoubtedly read and
admired the wonderful production of the Epigoniad, and that
you have so much love for arts, and for your native country,
as to be very industrious in propagating the fame of it. It is
certainly a most singular production, full of sublimity and
genius, <!-- Page 26 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_26" id="Page_v2_26">[26]</a></span>adorned by a noble, harmonious, forcible, and even
correct versification. We generally think the story deficient
and uninteresting; but perhaps the new fancy of crossing the
invention of all modern romance-writers may make some
atonement, and even bestow an air of novelty on the imitation
of Homer. As I cannot but hope that this work will soon become
the subject of conversation in London, I shall take this
opportunity of supplying you with some anecdotes with regard
to the author, besides such as you already know,&mdash;of his being
a very worthy and a very entertaining man, adorned with all
that simplicity of manners, so common to great men, and even
with some of that rusticity and negligence which serve to
abate that envy to which they are so much exposed.</p>

<p>"You know he is a farmer's son, in the neighbourhood of this
town, where there are a great number of pigeon-houses. The
farmers are very much infested with the pigeons, and Wilkie's
father planted him often as a scarecrow (an office for which
he is well qualified) in the midst of his fields of wheat. It
was in this situation that he confessed he first conceived the
design of his epic poem, and even executed part of it. He
carried out his Homer with him, together with a table, and pen
and ink, and a great rusty gun. He composed and wrote two or
three lines, till a flock of pigeons settled in the field,
then rose up, ran towards them, and fired at them; returned
again to his former station, and added a rhyme or two more,
till he met with a fresh interruption.</p>

<p>"Two or three years ago, Jemmy Russel put a very pleasant
trick on an English physician, one Dr. Roebuck, who was
travelling in this country. Russel carried him out one day on
horseback to see the outlets of the town, and purposely led
him by Wilkie's <!-- Page 27 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_27" id="Page_v2_27">[27]</a></span>farm. He saw the bard at a small distance,
sowing his corn, with a sheet about him, all besmeared with
dirt and sweat, with a coat and visage entirely proportioned
to his occupation. Russel says to his companion, 'Here is a
fellow, a peasant, with whom I have some business: let us call
him.' He made a sign, and Wilkie came to them: some questions
were asked him with regard to the season, to his farm and
husbandry, which he readily answered; but soon took an
opportunity of digressing to the Greek poets, and enlarging on
that branch of literature. Dr. Roebuck, who had scarce
understood his rustic English, or rather his broad Scotch,
immediately comprehended him, for his Greek was admirable; and
on leaving him, he could not forbear expressing the highest
admiration to Russel, that a clown, a rustic, a mere hind,
such as he saw this fellow was, should be possessed of so much
erudition. 'Is it usual,' says he, 'for your peasants in
Scotland to read the Greek poets?'&mdash;'O Yes,' replies Russel,
very coolly, 'we have long winter evenings; and in what can
they employ themselves better, than in reading the Greek
poets?' Roebuck left the country in a full persuasion that
there are at least a dozen farmers in every parish who read
Homer, Hesiod, and Sophocles, every winter-evening, to their
families; and, if ever he writes an account of his travels, it
is likely he will not omit so curious a circumstance.</p>

<p>"Wilkie is now a settled minister at Ratho, within four miles
of the town.<a name="FNanchor_27:1_23" id="FNanchor_27:1_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_27:1_23" class="fnanchor">[27:1]</a> He possesses about £80 or £90 a-year, which
he esteems exorbitant riches. Formerly, when he had only £20,
as helper, he said that he could not conceive what article,
either of human convenience or pleasure he was deficient in,
<!-- Page 28 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_28" id="Page_v2_28">[28]</a></span>nor what any man could mean by desiring more money. He
possesses several branches of erudition, besides the Greek
poetry; and, particularly, is a very profound geometrician, a
science commonly very incompatible with the lively imagination
of a poet. He has even made some new discoveries in that
science; and he told me, that, when a young man, he threw
cross and pile, whether he should devote himself chiefly to
mathematics or to poetry, and fears that rather he crossed the
bent of his genius in taking to the latter. Yet this man, who
has composed the second epic poem in our language! understands
so little of orthography, that, regularly through the whole
poem, he spelled the word yield in this manner, 'ealde;' and I
had great difficulty to convince him of his mistake.</p>

<p>"I fancy our friend, Robertson, will be able to publish his
History next winter. You are sufficiently acquainted with the
merit of this work; and really it is admirable how many men of
genius this country produces at present. Is it not strange
that, at a time when we have lost our princes, our
parliaments, our independent government,&mdash;even the presence of
our chief nobility; are unhappy, in our accent and
pronunciation; speak a very corrupt dialect of the tongue we
make use of,&mdash;is it not strange, I say, that, in these
circumstances, we should really be the people most
distinguished for literature in Europe?</p>

<p>"Having spoke so much to Mr. Elliot, the man of letters, you
must now allow me to say a few words to Mr. Elliot, the lord
of the admiralty. There is a cousin-german of mine, Alexander
Edgar, who is midshipman in the Vestal, off Harwich, and has
passed his trials, above four months ago, for a lieutenantcy.
He always behaved well in all his service, which has been very
long; and, almost from his infancy, he has <!-- Page 29 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_29" id="Page_v2_29">[29]</a></span>had the good-will,
and even friendship, of all his captains; is modest, sober,
frugal, and attentive, and very deserving of promotion. I
recommended him to Mr. Oswald, who always protected him, but
can no longer be of service to him. He is of a very good
family, though his father spent his estate and died a
bankrupt; and the poor lad has now scarce any other friends
than what I can procure him: permit me the freedom of
recommending him to your protection. If I did not think him
worthy of it, I should not venture to do so, notwithstanding
his near relationship to me. I think I ought to make some
apologies for this liberty I use with you; but I think it
would be wronging our friendship to make too many. I am, dear
sir, your most obedient humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_29:1_24" id="FNanchor_29:1_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:1_24" class="fnanchor">[29:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Wilkie's Epigoniad, of which few ordinary readers now know more than the
name, if even that be very generally remembered south of the Tweed,
inspired many zealous Scotsmen of the day, with the belief that their
country had, at last, produced a great epic poet: but the national
feeling was not responded to in England.<a name="FNanchor_29:2_25" id="FNanchor_29:2_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_29:2_25" class="fnanchor">[29:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 30 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_30" id="Page_v2_30">[30]</a></span>Finding that the Epigoniad was attacked by the English critics, Hume
was determined to be the champion of his countryman's fame against all
comers; and accordingly addressed a letter to the editor of <cite>The
Critical Review</cite> , containing a long complimentary criticism, in which he
says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>There remained a tradition among the Greeks, that Homer had
taken this second siege of Thebes for the subject of a poem,
which is lost; and our author seems to have pleased himself
with the thoughts of reviving the work, as well as of treading
in the footsteps of his favourite author. The actors are
mostly the same with those of the Iliad; Diomede is the hero;
Ulysses, Agamemnon, Menelaus, Nestor, Idomeneus, Merion, even
Thersites, all appear in different passages of the poem; and
act parts suitable to the lively characters drawn of them by
that great master. The whole turn of this new poem would
almost lead us to imagine, that the Scottish bard had found
the lost manuscript of that father of poetry, and had made a
faithful translation of it into English. Longinus imagines,
that the Odyssey was executed by Homer in his <!-- Page 31 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_31" id="Page_v2_31">[31]</a></span>old age; we
shall allow the Iliad to be the work of his middle age; and we
shall suppose that the Epigoniad was the essay of his youth,
where his noble and sublime genius breaks forth by frequent
intervals, and gives strong symptoms of that constant flame
which distinguished its meridian.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>The story of a poem, whatever may be imagined, is the least
essential part of it; the force of the versification, the
vivacity of the images, the justness of the descriptions, the
natural play of the passions, are the chief circumstances
which distinguish the great poet from the prosaic novelist,
and give him so high a rank among the heroes in literature;
and I will venture to affirm, that all these advantages,
especially the three former, are to be found, in an eminent
degree, in the Epigoniad. The author, inspired with the true
genius of Greece, and smit with the most profound veneration
for Homer, disdains all frivolous ornaments; and relying
entirely on his sublime imagination, and his nervous and
harmonious expression, has ventured to present to his reader
the naked beauties of nature, and challenges for his partisans
all the admirers of genuine antiquity.<a name="FNanchor_31:1_26" id="FNanchor_31:1_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_31:1_26" class="fnanchor">[31:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In his conduct on this occasion, Hume exhibited strong national
partiality. It may seem at first sight at variance with some of his
other characteristics; but it is undoubtedly true, that Hume was imbued
with an intense spirit of nationality. It was a nationality, however, of
a peculiar and restricted character. He cared little about the heroism
of his country, or even its struggles for independence: Wallace, Bruce,
and the Black Douglas, were, in his eyes, less interesting than Ulysses
or Æneas,</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">&mdash;&mdash;carent quia vate sacro.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But in that arena which he thought the greatest, in the theatre where
intellect exhibits her might, he panted to see his country first and
greatest. No Scotsman <!-- Page 32 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_32" id="Page_v2_32">[32]</a></span>could write a book of respectable talent without
calling forth his loud and warm eulogiums. Wilkie was to be the Homer,
Blacklock the Pindar, and Home the Shakspere, or something still
greater, of his country. On those who were even his rivals in his own
peculiar walks&mdash;Adam Smith, Robertson, Ferguson, and Henry, he heaped
the same honest, hearty commendation. He urged them to write; he raised
the spirit of literary ambition in their breasts; he found publishers
for their works; and, when these were completed, he trumpeted the
praises of the authors through society.</p>

<p>The following letter shows how accidentally Hume became acquainted with
a matter, which, according to modern notions, should have formed part of
his systematic studies, before he began to write a history of England.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 9th Aug. 1757.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I can easily perceive that your friends were no
lawyers, who said that there was no statute in Henry the
Seventh's reign, which facilitated the alienation of lands,
and broke the ancient entails: it is 4 Hen. VII. cap. 24; but
a man may read that passage fifty times, and not find any
thing that seems, in the least, to point that way. I should
certainly have overlooked the meaning of it, had I not been
guided by Lord Kames. You must know that it was a practice in
the courts of justice, before Henry the Seventh's time, to
break entails by a device which seems very ridiculous, but
which is continued to this day, and first received the
sanction of law during the reign of that prince. You have an
entailed estate, I suppose, and want to break the entail. You
agree with me <!-- Page 33 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_33" id="Page_v2_33">[33]</a></span>that I am to claim the estate by a sham title,
prior to the first entailer; you confess in court that my
title is good and valid; the judges, upon this confession of
the party, adjudge the estate to me; upon which I immediately
restore the estate to you, free and unencumbered; and by this
hocus-pocus the entail is broke.&mdash;Such was the practice,
pretty common before Henry the Seventh. All that the
parliament then did, was to regulate the method of proceeding
in this fine device, and to determine that the titles of
minors, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femmes couvert</span>, were not to be injured by it. As
to other people, who had an interest to preserve an entail,
and who had any good reason to plead in their own favour, they
would naturally appear for themselves. This practice is called
a fine, and a recovery: fine, from the Latin word <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">finis</span>;
because it forecloses all parties, and puts a final issue to
their claims and pretensions: a recovery, because a man
thereby recovers his estate, without the encumbrance of an
entail.</p>

<p>"By the bye, I am told, that there are many of these practices
still continued in the law of England; which are as foolish,
juvenile, and ridiculous, as are to be met with in &mdash;&mdash; I mean
in &mdash;&mdash; I would be understood to mean in &mdash;&mdash; any craft or
profession of the world.<a name="FNanchor_33:1_27" id="FNanchor_33:1_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_33:1_27" class="fnanchor">[33:1]</a></p>

<p>"I am writing the History of England, from the accession of
Henry the Seventh, and am some years advanced in Henry the
Eighth. I undertook this work because I was tired of idleness,
and found reading alone, after I had often perused all good
books, (which I think is soon done,) somewhat a languid
occupation. As to the approbation or esteem of those
<!-- Page 34 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_34" id="Page_v2_34">[34]</a></span>blockheads who call themselves the public, and whom a
bookseller, a lord, a priest, or a party can guide, I do most
heartily despise it. I shall be able, I think, to make a
tolerable smooth, well-told tale of the history of England
during that period; but I own I have not yet been able to
throw much new light into it. I begin the Reformation
to-morrow.</p>

<p>"I find the public, with you, have rejected the Epigoniad, for
the present. They may do so if they please; but it has a great
deal of merit, much more than any one of them is capable of
throwing into a work.</p>

<p>"I disapprove very much of Ferguson's scruples, with regard to
entering into Lord Bute's family, with the inspection of more
than one boy; but I hope Lord Bute will conform himself to his
delicacy, at least if he wants to have a man of sense,
knowledge, taste, elegance, and morals, for a tutor to his
son.<a name="FNanchor_34:1_28" id="FNanchor_34:1_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:1_28" class="fnanchor">[34:1]</a></p>

<p>"I am obliged to you for your good intentions, with regard to
my cousin; but you must express yourself otherwise, than by
saying that you will concur with the rest of my friends in
endeavouring to promote him; for now that Oswald is out of
court, whom have I besides to apply to? Dear Sir, your most
obedient humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_34:2_29" id="FNanchor_34:2_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_34:2_29" class="fnanchor">[34:2]</a></p>

<p>"As to my opinions, you know I defend none of them positively;
I only propose my doubts where I am so unhappy as not to
receive the same conviction with the rest of mankind. It
surprises me much to see any body who pretends to be a man of
letters, <!-- Page 35 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_35" id="Page_v2_35">[35]</a></span>discover anger on that account; since it is certain,
by the experience of all ages, that nothing contributes more
to the progress of learning than such disputes and novelties.</p>

<p>"Apropos to anger; I am positively assured, that Dr. Warburton
wrote that letter to himself, which you sent me; and indeed
the style discovers him sufficiently.<a name="FNanchor_35:1_30" id="FNanchor_35:1_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_35:1_30" class="fnanchor">[35:1]</a> I should answer
him; but he attacks so <!-- Page 36 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_36" id="Page_v2_36">[36]</a></span>small a corner of my building, that I
can abandon it without drawing great consequences after it. If
he would come into the field and dispute concerning the
principal topics of my philosophy, I should probably accept
the challenge: at present nothing could tempt me to take the
pen in hand but anger, of which I feel myself incapable, even
upon this provocation.</p>

<p>"I have finished the Index to the new collection of my pieces;
this Index cost me more trouble than I was aware of when I
began it. I am obliged to Mr. Strahan, for the uncommon pains
he has taken in making it correct. The Errata which I have
given, consist mostly of small alterations in the style, which
I made myself. You know I always expect half-a-dozen of copies
on each new edition. I would wish that Mr. Strahan would
accept of one, as a proof of the sense which I have of his
care on this occasion. Please keep one by you, which I fancy I
shall have occasion to send abroad; and be so good as to send
the other four, with any other parcel you are sending hither.
I am very assiduous in writing a new volume of History, and am
now pretty well advanced. I find the whole will be comprised
in one volume, though somewhat more bulky than any of the
former. The period of time is a great deal longer than that of
either of the former, but is not near so full of interesting
matter; and as the original historians are much fewer, there
are not so many circumstances <!-- Page 37 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_37" id="Page_v2_37">[37]</a></span>transmitted to us. I am pretty
certain, that I shall be able to deliver to you the manuscript
about a twelvemonth hence, and shall certainly be in London
myself for that purpose. You seemed desirous that we should
mutually enter into articles about this volume; which I
declined, till I should be so much advanced as to be sure of
my resolution of executing it, and could judge with some
certainty of the bulk. Now that I am satisfied in both these
particulars, I am willing to engage with you for the same
price, viz. seven hundred pounds, payable three months after
the publication. If you approve of this proposal, please write
me a letter for that purpose; and I shall also, in return,
send you an obligatory letter. I think this justice is due to
you, that you may see I do not intend, on account of any
success, to screw up the price, or ask beyond what you have
already allowed me, which, I own, was very reasonable.</p>

<p>"Mr. Dalrymple has paid me twenty pounds and a crown. I can
never meet with Mr. Wright, though I call often at his shop.
Mr. Balfour does not name any day.</p>

<p>"I am glad of the approbation which Mr. Dalrymple's book meets
with; I think it really deserves it.<a name="FNanchor_37:1_31" id="FNanchor_37:1_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_37:1_31" class="fnanchor">[37:1]</a></p>

<p>"Nothing surprises me more than the ill usage which the
Epigoniad has received. Every body here likes it extremely.
The plan and story is not so much admired, as the poetry and
versification; but your critics seem willing to allow it no
merit at all. I fancy it has not been enough dispersed; and
that your engaging on it, would extremely forward its success.
The whole edition is out. There were five <!-- Page 38 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_38" id="Page_v2_38">[38]</a></span>hundred and fifty
disposed of here; two hundred sent to London. As the author is
my very good friend and acquaintance, I should be much pleased
to bring you to an understanding together. If the bad success
on the first edition has not discouraged you, I would engage
him to make you proposals for that purpose. He will correct
all the blemishes remarked. I should not be displeased that
you read to Dr. Warburton, the paragraph in the first page of
my letter, with regard to himself. The hopes of getting an
answer, might probably engage him to give us something farther
of the same kind; which, at least, saves you the expense of
advertising. I see the doctor likes a literary squabble.</p>

<p>"I would be glad to know, how near you think you are to a new
edition of my History, and whether you intend a duodecimo
edition of these philosophical pieces. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_38:1_32" id="FNanchor_38:1_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_38:1_32" class="fnanchor">[38:1]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">David Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Clephane</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 3d Sept. 1757.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I am charmed to find you so punctual a
correspondent. I always knew you to be a good friend, though I
was afraid that I had lost you, and that you had joined that
great multitude who abused me, and reproached me with
Paganism, and Jacobitism, and many other wretched isms, of
which I am only guilty of a part.</p>

<p>"I believe a man, when he is once an author, is an author for
life; for I am now very busily engaged in writing another
volume of history, and have crept backwards to the reign of
Henry the Seventh. I wish indeed that I had begun there; for,
by that means, I should have been able, without making any
digression, <!-- Page 39 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_39" id="Page_v2_39">[39]</a></span>by the plain course of the narration, to have
shown how absolute the authority was which the English kings
then possessed, and that the Stuarts did little or nothing
more than continue matters in the former track, which the
people were determined no longer to admit. By this means I
should have escaped the reproach of the most terrible ism of
them all, that of Jacobitism. I shall certainly be in London
next summer; and probably to remain there during life; at
least, if I can settle myself to my mind, which I beg you to
have an eye to. A room in a sober, discreet family, who would
not be averse to admit a sober, discreet, virtuous, frugal,
regular, quiet, good-natured man of a bad character,&mdash;such a
room, I say, would suit me extremely, especially if I could
take most of my meals in the family; and more especially
still, if it was not far distant from Dr. Clephane's. I shall
then be able, dear doctor, to spend £150 a-year, which is the
sum upon which, I remember, you formerly undertook me. But I
would not have you reckon upon <em>probabilities</em>, as you then
called them, for I am resolved to write no more. I shall read
and correct, and chat and be idle, the rest of my life.</p>

<p>"I must now make room for Sir Harry, who smiles at the sum at

<p>Among the officers of the Scottish Royal Regiment who served in the
expedition to Port L'Orient, and afterwards continued in terms of
familiar acquaintance with Hume, was captain, afterwards Colonel
Edmondstoune, of Newton in Perthshire. His letters, which were preserved
by Hume, and will occasionally be <!-- Page 40 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_40" id="Page_v2_40">[40]</a></span>cited in these pages, show that he
was a man of wit and learning. Frequent allusions to him, under the name
of Guidelianus, have already occurred in Hume's letters to mutual
friends. The following, graceful and thoroughly amiable as it is, is
apparently the earliest of Hume's letters to him which has been
preserved.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Captain Edmondstoune</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 29th Sept. 1757.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Edmondstoune</span>,&mdash;I believe it is a rule in law, that any
summons prevents prescription; and in like manner, that the
wakening a process keeps one's rank in the lords' row.<a name="FNanchor_40:1_34" id="FNanchor_40:1_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_40:1_34" class="fnanchor">[40:1]</a>
It is with some such view that I now write to you; not to send
you a formal letter, which would require a formal answer, and
would therefore get no answer at all: but just to take a shake
of your hand, and ask you how you do, and speak a little
nonsense to you as usual, and then fall into s[ilence] without
giving myself the trouble of supporting the conversation any
lon[ger]; and, in a word, keep you from forgetting that you
have some such friend in the world as myself.</p>

<p>"But pray, why did you not write me as you promised and give
me your direction? Was you afraid I should write to you? You
see I can find out a method of directing to you without your
information.</p>

<p>"Tell me about the Epigoniad. Was there ever so much fine
versification bestowed on so indifferent a story? Has it had
any success in Ireland? I fancy <!-- Page 41 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_41" id="Page_v2_41">[41]</a></span>not; for the criticklings in
Dublin depend on the criticklings in London, who depend on the
booksellers, who depend on their interest, which depends on
their printing a book themselves. This is the cause why
Wilkie's book is at present neglected, or damned, as they call
it: but I am much mistaken if it end so. Pray what says the
primate of it? I hear he has the generosity to support damned
books till the resurrection, and that he is one of the saints
who pray them out of purgatory. I hope he is an honest fellow
and one of [us.] Captain Masterton told me, that he was not
quite of my opinion with regard to the 'Douglas,' and that he
blamed my dedicatory address to the author. But I persist
still, and will prove in spite of him and you, and of every
man who [wears eit]her black or scarlet, that it is an
admirable tragedy, comparable [to the exce]llent pieces of the
good age of Louis Quatorze. The author is here at present, and
is refitting his 'Agis' for the theatre, which I hope will
have justice done it. <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il est le mieux renté de touts les
beaux esprits.</i> He has a pension from his Royal Highness the
Prince of Wales, as you have probably heard.</p>

<p>"I hear sometimes from the Doctor, who desires me to tell him
something about you. But I am no necromancer; only, as the
ancients said,&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prudentia est quædam divinatio</i>. I conjecture
that you are lounging, and reading, and playing at whist, and
blaming yourself for not writing letters, and yet persisting
in the neglect of your duty."<a name="FNanchor_41:1_35" id="FNanchor_41:1_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_41:1_35" class="fnanchor">[41:1]</a></p>

<p>The following is the second letter in which we find Hume appreciating
the merits of his friend and <!-- Page 42 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_42" id="Page_v2_42">[42]</a></span>rival, Robertson. There is no passage in
literary history, perhaps, more truly dignified, than the perfect
cordiality and sincere interchange of services between two men, whose
claims on the admiration of the world came in so close competition with
each other.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 6th April, 1758.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very glad that Mr. Robertson is entering on
terms with you. It was indeed my advice to him, when he set
out for London, that he should think of no other body; and I
ventured to assure him that he would find your way of dealing
frank, and open, and generous. He read me part of his History,
and I had an opportunity of reading another part of it in
manuscript above a twelvemonth ago. Upon the whole, my
expectations, both from what I saw, and from my knowledge of
the author, were very much raised, and I consider it as a work
of uncommon merit. I know that he has employed himself with
great diligence and care in collecting the facts: his style is
lively and entertaining; and he judges with temper and
candour. He is a man generally known and esteemed in this
country: and we look upon him very deservedly as inferior to
nobody in capacity and learning. Hamilton and Balfour have
offered him a very unusual price; no less than five hundred
pounds for one edition of two thousand; but I own, that I
should be better pleased to see him in your hands. I only
inform you of this fact, that you may see how high the general
expectations are of Mr. Robertson's performance. It will have
a quick sale in this country, from the character of the
author; and in England, from the merit of the work, as soon as
it is known.</p>

<p><!-- Page 43 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_43" id="Page_v2_43">[43]</a></span>"Some part of his subject is common with mine; but as his work
is a History of Scotland, mine of England, we do not
interfere; and it will rather be an amusement to the reader to
compare our method of treating the same subject. I give you
thanks, however, for your attention in asking my
opinion."<a name="FNanchor_43:1_36" id="FNanchor_43:1_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_43:1_36" class="fnanchor">[43:1]</a></p>

<p>The following is from another letter on the same subject.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 20th June, 1758.</p>

<p>"I send enclosed a letter from Mr. Robertson. He wishes it
were practicable to send him more than one sheet every post. I
am afraid, if this be not done, our publications will
interfere, which would be disagreeable to you as well as to
both of us.</p>

<p>"I have read a small pamphlet called 'Sketches,' which, from
the style, I take to be Dr. Armstrong's, though the public
voice gives it to Allan Ramsay.<a name="FNanchor_43:2_37" id="FNanchor_43:2_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_43:2_37" class="fnanchor">[43:2]</a> I find the ingenious
author, whoever he be, ridicules the new method of spelling,
as he calls it; but that method of spelling <em>honor</em>, instead
of <em>honour</em>, was Lord Bolingbroke's, Dr. Middleton's, and Mr.
Pope's; besides many other eminent writers'. However, to tell
truth, I hate to be any way particular in a trifle; and
therefore, if Mr. Strahan has not printed off above ten or
twelve sheets, I should not be displeased if you told him to
follow the usual, that is, his own way of spelling throughout;
we shall make the other volumes conformable to it: if he be
advanced farther, there is no great matter."<a name="FNanchor_43:3_38" id="FNanchor_43:3_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_43:3_38" class="fnanchor">[43:3]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 11th May, 1758.</p>

<p>"I have the prospect of paying my respects to you this autumn,
in London. I am now come within sight of land, and am drawing
near to a period of that volume which I had undertaken. I find
the subject curious; and I believe that this volume will
contain some novelty, as well as greater accuracy of
composition, than is employed by our ordinary historians. I
could add, greater than is requisite to please the taste of
the public,&mdash;at least if we may judge by the vast success of
Dr. Smollett's history. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanitas vanitatum, atque omnia
vanitas</i>, says the Preacher; the great object of us authors,
and of you orators and statesmen, is to gain applause; and you
see at what rate it is to be purchased. I fancy there is a
future state, to give poets, historians, and philosophers
their due reward, and to distribute to them those recompenses
which are so strangely shared out in this life. It is of
little consequence that posterity does them justice, if they
are for ever to be ignorant of it, and are to remain in
perpetual slumber in their literary paradise. However, it is
some comfort, that virtue is its own reward, and that a man
cannot employ himself in the cultivation of letters without
reaping a real present satisfaction from his industry. I am,
dear sir, your most obliged humble servant.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I am sorry to hear that the bill for the importation of
Irish cattle is rejected. Besides other arguments for it, I
remember a strong argument which was used in Charles II.'s
time against the <!-- Page 45 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_45" id="Page_v2_45">[45]</a></span>prohibition, when it was first laid on: it
was affirmed that the shipping employed in that commerce was
nearly equal to that which served for the carriage of coal
from Newcastle to London. It is not improbable that this
argument has, at present, escaped all the reasoners on that
subject; and I thought it a proper one to be suggested to a
lord of the Admiralty. It is to be found, if my memory do not
deceive me, in Carte's Ormond, and was employed by that
duke."<a name="FNanchor_45:1_39" id="FNanchor_45:1_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:1_39" class="fnanchor">[45:1]</a></p>

<p>In the year 1759, Adam Ferguson was appointed professor of natural
philosophy in the university of Edinburgh. From the following
correspondence, it appears that Hume and others were desirous that Smith
should occupy a chair in Edinburgh, and, apparently, the same that was
obtained by Ferguson,<a name="FNanchor_45:2_40" id="FNanchor_45:2_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_45:2_40" class="fnanchor">[45:2]</a> and that Ferguson should succeed Smith in
Glasgow. The singular terms on which the Edinburgh professorship appears
to have been disposed of, were, probably, not such as Smith would accede
to; and we afterwards find Hume conducting a negotiation for Ferguson
alone.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"8th June, 1758.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I sit down to write to you along with Johnstone;
and as we have been talking over the matter, it is probable we
shall employ the same arguments. As he is the younger lawyer,
I leave him to open the case, and, suppose that you have read
his letter first. We are certain that the settlement of you
<!-- Page 46 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_46" id="Page_v2_46">[46]</a></span>here, and of Ferguson at Glasgow, would be perfectly easy, by
Lord Milton's interest. The prospect of prevailing with
Abercromby is also very good; for the same statesman, by his
influence over the town council, could oblige him either to
attend, which he never would do, or dispose of the office for
the money which he gave for it. The only real difficulty is,
then, with you. Pray, then, consider that this is, perhaps,
the only opportunity we shall ever have of getting you to
town. I dare swear that you think the difference of place is
worth paying something for; and yet it will really cost you
nothing. You made above £100 a-year, by your class, when in
this place, though you had not the character of professor. We
cannot suppose that it will be less than £130 after you are
settled. John Stevenson; and it is John Stevenson, makes near
£150, as we were informed upon inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_46:1_41" id="FNanchor_46:1_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_46:1_41" class="fnanchor">[46:1]</a> Here is £100
a-year for eight years' purchase; which is a cheap purchase,
even considered as the way of a bargain. We flatter ourselves
that you rate our company at something; and the prospect of
settling Ferguson will be an additional inducement. For,
though we think of making him take up the project if you
refuse it, yet it is uncertain whether he will consent; and it
is attended, in his case, with many very obvious objections. I
beseech you, therefore, to weigh all these motives over again.
The alteration of these circumstances merit that you should
put the matter again in deliberation. I had a letter from Miss
Hepburn, where she regrets very much that you are settled at
Glasgow, and that we had the chance of seeing you so seldom. I
am," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Rev. Sir</span>,&mdash;I am informed, by the late Rev. Mr. John Home,
that the still Rev. Adam Ferguson's affair is so far on a good
footing, that it is agreed to refer the matter to the Justice
Clerk, whether more shall be paid to Mr. Abercromby than he
himself gave for that professorship. Now, as it is obvious
that, in these kinds of references, where the question is not
of law and justice, the circumstances of the person are to be
considered, I beg of you to inform my Lord of the true state
of the case. Ferguson must borrow almost the whole sum which
he pays for this office. If any more, therefore, be asked than
£1000, it would be the most ruinous thing in the world for him
to accept of the office. I am even of opinion that if any
other method of subsistence offered, it were preferable to
this scheme of paying the length of £1000; at least such would
be my sentiments, if the case were mine.</p>

<p>"If the Justice Clerk considers the matter aright, he will
never agree to so unreasonable a demand as that of paying
more; and I hope you will second these arguments with all your
usual eloquence, by which you so successfully confound the
devices of Satan, and bring sinners to repentance. I am, Rev.
Sir, your most obsequious humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_47:3_44" id="FNanchor_47:3_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_47:3_44" class="fnanchor">[47:3]</a></p>

<p>Towards the end of the year 1758, but at what particular time is not
more minutely known, Hume went to London, and resided in Lisle Street,
Leicester <!-- Page 48 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_48" id="Page_v2_48">[48]</a></span>Fields. His object probably was to superintend the printing
of the "History of the House of Tudor;" but he was able at the same time
to perform essential services to his friend Dr. Robertson, whose
"History of Scotland" was then going through the press in London. Of
Hume's letters to Dr. Robertson, several have been published, though
only in a fragmentary form, in Dugald Stewart's "Life of
Robertson."<a name="FNanchor_48:1_45" id="FNanchor_48:1_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:1_45" class="fnanchor">[48:1]</a> The portions thus preserved, are naturally those which
have most relation to the person to whom they are addressed; but of the
letters themselves, which doubtless, like many others from the same
hand, contained some curious particulars of their author's habits and
passing thoughts, no trace has been found.<a name="FNanchor_48:2_46" id="FNanchor_48:2_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_48:2_46" class="fnanchor">[48:2]</a> Several of these
letters, written while Robertson's work was at press, have relation to
minor historical questions, which have subsequently been settled. The
following extracts are given, from the parts which have least reference
to these details.</p>

<p>I am afraid that you, as well as myself, have drawn Mary's
character with too great softenings. She was, undoubtedly, a
violent woman at all times. You will see in <cite>Murden</cite>  proofs of
the utmost rancour against her innocent, good-natured, dutiful
son. She certainly disinherited him. What think you of a
conspiracy for kidnapping him, and delivering him a prisoner
to the King of Spain, never to recover his liberty till he
should turn Catholic? Tell Goodall, that if he can but give me

fill my letter with a list of names. Mallet told me that he
was sure there was no Englishman capable of composing such a
work. The town will have it that you was educated at Oxford,
thinking it impossible for a mere untravelled Scotsman to
produce such language. In short, you may depend on the success
of your work, and that your name is known very much to your

such fools as to have given way to jealousy, to have
entertained animosity and malignity against each other, and to
have rent all our acquaintance into parties, what a noble
amusement we should have exhibited to the blockheads, which
now they are likely to be disappointed of. All the people
whose friendship or judgment either of us value, are friends
to both, and will be pleased with the success of both, as we
will be with that of each other. I declare to you I have not

had we communicated before printing, which was always my

did, and I hope always will, subsist between us. I speak this
chiefly on my own account. For though I had the perusal of
your sheets before I printed, I was not able to derive
sufficient benefits from them, or indeed to make any
alteration by their assistance. There still remain, I fear,
many errors, of which you could have convinced me, if we had
canvassed the matter in conversation. Perhaps I might also
have been sometimes no less fortunate <!-- Page 50 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_50" id="Page_v2_50">[50]</a></span>with you. Particularly

Murray's conduct with the Duke of Norfolk was no way
dishonourable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Dr. Blair tells me that Prince Edward is reading you, and is
charmed. I hear the same of the Princess and Prince of Wales.
But what will really give you pleasure, I lent my copy to
Elliot during the holidays, who thinks it one of the finest
performances he ever read; and though he expected much, he
finds more. He remarked, however, (which is also my opinion,)
that in the beginning, before your pen was sufficiently
accustomed to the historic style, you employed too many
digressions and reflections. This was also somewhat my own
case, which I have corrected in my new edition.</p>

<p>Millar was proposing to publish me about the middle of March;
but I shall communicate to him your desire, even though I
think it entirely groundless, as you will likewise think,
after you have read my volume. He has very needlessly delayed
your publication till the 1st of February, at the desire of
the Edinburgh booksellers, who could no way be affected by a
publication in London. I was exceedingly sorry not to be able
to comply with your desire, when you expressed your wish that
I should not write this period. I could not write downward.
For when you find occasion, by new discoveries, to correct
your opinion with regard to facts which passed in Queen
Elizabeth's days, who, that has not the best opportunities of
informing himself, could venture to relate any recent
transactions? I must, therefore, have abandoned altogether
this scheme of the English history, in which I had proceeded
so far, if I had not acted as I did. You will see what light
and force this History of the Tudors bestows on that of the
Stuarts. Had I been prudent, I should have begun with it. I
care not to boast, but I will venture to say, that I have now
effectually stopped the mouths of all those villanous Whigs
who railed at me.</p>

<p>You are so kind as to ask me about my coming down. I can yet
answer nothing. I have the strangest reluctance to change
places. I lived several years happy with my brother at
Ninewells; and had not his marriage changed a little the state
of the family, I believe I should have lived and died there. I
used every expedient to evade this journey to <!-- Page 51 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_51" id="Page_v2_51">[51]</a></span>London; yet it
is now uncertain whether I shall ever leave it. I have had
some invitations, and some intentions, of taking a trip to
Paris; but I believe it will be safer for me not to go
thither, for I might probably settle there for life. No one
was ever endowed with so great a portion of the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vis
inertiae</i>. But as I live here very privately, and avoid as
much as possible (and it is easily possible) all connexion
with the great, I believe I should be better in Edinburgh.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. As to the "Age of Leo the Tenth," it was Warton
himself who intended to write it; but he has not wrote it, and
probably never will. If I understand your hint, I should
conjecture, that you had some thoughts of taking up the
subject. But how can you acquire knowledge of the great works
of sculpture, architecture, and painting, by which that age
was chiefly distinguished? Are you versed in all the anecdotes
of the Italian literature? These questions I heard proposed in
a company of literati, when I inquired concerning this design
of Warton. They applied their remarks to that gentleman, who
yet, they say, has travelled. I wish they do not, all of them,
fall more fully on you. However, you must not be idle. May I
venture to suggest to you the Ancient History, particularly
that of Greece? I think Rollin's success might encourage you;
nor need you be in the least intimidated by his merit. That
author has no other merit but a certain facility and sweetness
of narration; but has loaded his work with silly
puerilities.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>I forgot to tell you, that two days ago I was in the House of
Commons, where an English gentleman came to me, and told me
that he had lately sent to a grocer's shop for a pound of
raisins, which he received wrapped up in a paper that he
showed me. How would you have turned pale at the sight! It was
a leaf of your History, and the very character of Queen
Elizabeth, which you had laboured so finely, little thinking
it would so soon come to so disgraceful an end. I happened a
little after to see Millar, and told him the story;
<!-- Page 52 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_52" id="Page_v2_52">[52]</a></span>consulting him, to be sure, on the fate of his new boasted
historian, of whom he was so fond. But the story proves more
serious than I apprehended: for he told Strahan, who thence
suspects villany among his apprentices and journeymen; and has
sent me very earnestly to know the gentleman's name, that he
may find out the grocer, and trace the matter to the bottom.
In vain did I remonstrate that this was sooner or later the
fate of all authors, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">serius, ocyus, sors exitura</i>. He will
not be satisfied; and begs me to keep my jokes for another
occasion. But that I am resolved not to do; and, therefore,
being repulsed by his passion and seriousness, I direct them
against you.</p>

<p>Next week I am published; and then I expect a constant
comparison will be made between Dr. Robertson and Mr. Hume. I
shall tell you in a few weeks which of these heroes is likely
to prevail. Meanwhile, I can inform both of them for their
comforts, that their combat is not likely to make half so much
noise as that between Broughton and the one-eyed coachman.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Vanitas vanitatum, atque omnia vanitas.</i> I shall still
except, however, the friendship and good opinion of worthy
men. I am, &amp;c.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">London, 12th March, 1759.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I believe I mentioned to you a French gentleman,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Helvetius</span>, whose book, "<cite  class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l'Esprit</cite>," was making a
great noise in Europe. He is a very fine genius, and has the
character of a very worthy man. My name is mentioned several
times in his work with marks of esteem; and he has made me an
offer, if I would translate his work into English, to
translate anew all my philosophical writings into French. He
says that none of them are well done, except that on the
"Natural History of Religion," by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Martigny</span>,<a name="FNanchor_52:1_47" id="FNanchor_52:1_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:1_47" class="fnanchor">[52:1]</a> a
counsellor of state. He added, that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Prevôt</span>,
celebrated for the <cite>Memoires d'un homme d'Honneur</cite> , and other
entertaining works,<a name="FNanchor_52:2_48" id="FNanchor_52:2_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_52:2_48" class="fnanchor">[52:2]</a> was just <!-- Page 53 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_53" id="Page_v2_53">[53]</a></span>now translating my
History. This account of Helvetius engaged me to send him over
the new editions of all my writings; and I have added your
History, which, I told him, was here published with great
applause; adding, that the subject was interesting, and the
execution masterly; and that it was probable some man of
letters at Paris may think that a translation of it would be
agreeable to the public. I thought that this was the best
method of executing your intentions. I could not expect that
any Frenchman here would be equal to the work. There is one
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Carraccioli</span>, who came to me and spoke something of translating
my new volume of History; but as he also mentioned his
intentions of translating Smollett, I gave him no
encouragement to proceed. The same reason would make me averse
to see you in his hands.</p>

<p>But though I have given this character of your work to
Monsieur Helvetius, I warn you, that this is the last time
that, either to Frenchman or Englishman, I shall ever speak
the least good of it. A plague take you! Here I sat near the
historical summit of Parnassus, immediately under Dr.
Smollett; and you have the impudence to squeeze yourself by
me, and place yourself directly under his feet. Do you imagine
that this can be agreeable to me? And must not I be guilty of
great simplicity, to contribute, by my endeavours, to your
thrusting me out of my place in Paris as well as at London?
But I give you warning that you will find the matter somewhat
difficult, at least in the former city. A friend of mine, who
is there, writes home to his father, the strangest accounts on
that head, which my modesty will not permit me to repeat, but
which it allowed me very deliciously to swallow.</p>

<p>I have got a good reason or pretence for excusing me to
Monsieur Helvetius, with regard to the translating his work. A
translation of it was previously advertised here.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">

<p class="letterdateit">&mdash;&mdash; 20th, 1759.</p>

<p>I am afraid that my letters will be tedious and disagreeable
to you by their uniformity. Nothing but continued <!-- Page 54 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_54" id="Page_v2_54">[54]</a></span>and
unvaried accounts of the same thing must in the end prove
disgusting. Yet since you will hear me speak on this subject,
I cannot help it, and must fatigue your ears as much as ours
are in this place, by endless and repeated, and noisy praises
of the "History of Scotland." Dr. Douglas told me yesterday,
that he had seen the Bishop of Norwich, who had just bought
the book, from the high commendations he heard of it from Mr.
Legge. Mallet told me that Lord Mansfield is at a loss whether
he shall most esteem the matter or the style. Elliot told me,
that being in company with George Grenville, that gentleman
was speaking loud in the same key. Our friend pretended
ignorance; said he knew the author, and if he thought the book
good for any thing, would send for it and read it. "Send for
it, by all means," said Mr. Grenville; "you have not read a
better book of a long time."&mdash;"But," said Elliot, "I suppose,
although the matter may be tolerable, as the author was never
on this side the Tweed till he wrote it, it must be very
barbarous in the expression." "By no means," cried Mr.
Grenville. "Had the author lived all his life in London, and
in the best company, he could not have expressed himself with
greater elegance and purity." Lord Lyttelton seems to think
that, since the time of St. Paul, there scarce has been a
better writer than Dr. Robertson. Mr. Walpole triumphs in the
success of his favourites the Scotch, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The great success of your book, beside its real
merit, is forwarded by its prudence, and by the deference paid
to established opinions. It gains also by its being your first
performance, and by its surprising the public, who are not
upon their guard against it. By reason of these two
circumstances, justice is more readily done to its merit;
which, however, is really so great, that I believe there is
scarce another instance of a first performance being so near
perfection.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">London, 29th May, 1759.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I had a letter from Helvetius lately, wrote
before your book arrived at Paris. He tells me, that the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé
Prevôt</span>, who had just finished the translation of my History,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">paroit très-disposé à traduire l'Histoire d'Ecosse <!-- Page 55 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_55" id="Page_v2_55">[55]</a></span>que vient
de faire Monsieur Robertson</span>. If he be engaged by my
persuasion, I shall have the satisfaction of doing you a real
credit and pleasure; for he is one of the best pens in
Paris.<a name="FNanchor_55:1_49" id="FNanchor_55:1_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:1_49" class="fnanchor">[55:1]</a> .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>Our friend Smith<a name="FNanchor_55:2_50" id="FNanchor_55:2_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:2_50" class="fnanchor">[55:2]</a> is very successful here, and
Gerard<a name="FNanchor_55:3_51" id="FNanchor_55:3_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:3_51" class="fnanchor">[55:3]</a> is very well received. The Epigoniad I cannot so
much promise for, though I have done all in my power to
forward it, particularly by writing a letter to <cite>The Critical
Review</cite> , which you may peruse. I find, however, some good
judges profess a great esteem for it: but <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">habent et sua fata
libelli</i>: however, if you want a little flattery to the
author, (which I own is very refreshing to an author) you may
tell him that Lord Chesterfield said to me he was a great
poet. I imagine that Wilkie will be very much elevated by
praise from an English Earl, and a knight of the Garter, and
an ambassador, and a secretary of state, and a man of so great
reputation. For I observe that the greatest rustics are
commonly most affected with such circumstances.</p>

<p>Ferguson's book<a name="FNanchor_55:4_52" id="FNanchor_55:4_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_55:4_52" class="fnanchor">[55:4]</a> has a great deal of genius and fine
writing, and will appear in time.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1759, Adam Smith published his "Theory of Moral Sentiments." The
following letters embody Hume's appreciation of that work.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">London, April 12, 1759.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I give you thanks for the agreeable present of your
Theory. Wedderburn and I made presents of our copies to such
of our acquaintances as we thought good judges, and proper to
spread the reputation of the book. I sent one to the Duke of
Argyle, to Lord Lyttelton, Horace Walpole, Soame Jenyns, and
Burke an Irish gentleman, who wrote lately a very pretty
Treatise on the Sublime. <!-- Page 56 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_56" id="Page_v2_56">[56]</a></span>Millar desired my permission to send
one in your name to Dr. Warburton.</p>

<p>I have delayed writing to you, till I could tell you something
of the success of the book, and could prognosticate, with some
probability, whether it should be finally damned to oblivion,
or should be registered in the temple of immortality. Though
it has been published only a few weeks, I think there appear
already such strong symptoms, that I can almost venture to
foretell its fate. It is, in short, this&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>But I have been interrupted in my letter by a foolish
impertinent visit of one who has lately come from Scotland. He
tells me that the University of Glasgow intend to declare
Rouet's office vacant, upon his going abroad with Lord Hope. I
question not but you will have our friend Ferguson in your
eye, in case another project for procuring him a place in the
University of Edinburgh should fail. Ferguson has very much
polished and improved his Treatise on Refinement;<a name="FNanchor_56:1_53" id="FNanchor_56:1_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:1_53" class="fnanchor">[56:1]</a> and
with some amendments it will make an admirable book, and
discovers an elegant and a singular genius. The Epigoniad, I
hope, will do; but it is somewhat up-hill work. As I doubt not
but you consult the Reviews sometimes at present, you will see
in <cite>The Critical Review</cite>  a letter upon that poem; and I desire
you to employ your conjectures in finding out the author. Let
me see a sample of your skill in knowing hands by your
guessing at the person.<a name="FNanchor_56:2_54" id="FNanchor_56:2_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_56:2_54" class="fnanchor">[56:2]</a></p>

<p>I am afraid of Kames' "Law Tracts." A man might as well think
of making a fine sauce by a mixture of wormwood and aloes, as
an agreeable composition by joining metaphysics and Scottish
law. However, the book, I believe, has merit; though few
people will take the pains of inquiring into it. But to return
to your book, and its success in this town, I must tell
you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A plague of interruptions! I ordered myself to be denied; and
yet here is one that has broke in upon me again. He is a man
of letters, and we have had a good deal of literary
conversation. You told me, that you was curious of literary
<!-- Page 57 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_57" id="Page_v2_57">[57]</a></span>anecdotes, and therefore I shall inform you of a few that
have come to my knowledge. I believe I have mentioned to you
already, Helvetius's book "<cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De l'Esprit</cite>." It is worth your
reading, not for its philosophy, which I do not highly value,
but for its agreeable composition. I had a letter from him a
few days ago, wherein he tells me that my name was much
oftener in the manuscript, but that the censor of books at
Paris obliged him to strike it out.</p>

<p>Voltaire has lately published a small work called <cite>Candide,
ou, l'Optimisme</cite> . I shall give you a detail of it. But what is
all this to my book, say you? My dear Mr. Smith, have
patience: compose yourself to tranquillity; show yourself a
philosopher in practice as well as profession: think on the
emptiness, and rashness, and futility of the common judgments
of men; how little they are regulated by reason in any
subject, much more in philosophical subjects, which so far
exceed the comprehension of the vulgar.</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line i4">&mdash;&mdash;Non si quid turbida Roma,</div>

</div></div>

<p>A wise man's kingdom is his own breast; or, if he ever looks
farther, it will only be to the judgment of a select few, who
are free from prejudices, and capable of examining his work.
Nothing, indeed, can be a stronger presumption of falsehood
than the approbation of the multitude; and Phocion, you know,
always suspected himself of some blunder, when he was attended
with the applauses of the populace.</p>

<p>Supposing, therefore, that you have duly prepared yourself for
the worst by all these reflections, I proceed to tell you the
melancholy news, that your book has been very unfortunate; for
the public seem disposed to applaud it extremely. It was
looked for by the foolish people with some impatience; and the
mob of literati are beginning already to be very loud in its
praises. Three bishops called yesterday at Millar's shop in
order to buy copies, and to ask questions about the author.
The Bishop of Peterborough said, he had passed the evening in
a company where he heard it extolled above all books in the
world. The Duke of Argyle is more decisive than he used to be
in its favour. I suppose he either considers it as an exotic,
or thinks the author will be <!-- Page 58 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_58" id="Page_v2_58">[58]</a></span>serviceable to him in the
Glasgow elections. Lord Lyttelton says that Robertson, and
Smith, and Bower,<a name="FNanchor_58:1_55" id="FNanchor_58:1_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:1_55" class="fnanchor">[58:1]</a> are the glories of English literature.
Oswald protests he does not know whether he has reaped more
instruction or entertainment from it. But you may easily judge
what reliance can be put on his judgment, who has been engaged
all his life in public business, and who never sees any faults
in his friends. Millar exults and brags that two-thirds of the
edition are already sold, and that he is now sure of success.
You see what a son of the earth that is, to value books only
by the profit they bring him. In that view, I believe it may
prove a very good book.</p>

<p>Charles Townsend, who passes for the cleverest fellow in
England, is so taken with the performance, that he said to
Oswald he would put the Duke of Buccleuch under the author's
care, and would make it worth his while to accept of that
charge. As soon as I heard this, I called on him twice, with a
view of talking with him about the matter, and of convincing
him of the propriety of sending that young nobleman to
Glasgow: for I could not hope, that he could offer you any
terms which would tempt you to renounce your professorship;
but I missed him. Mr. Townsend passes for being a little
uncertain in his resolutions; so perhaps you need not build
much on his sally.</p>

<p>In recompense for so many mortifying things, which nothing but
truth could have extorted from me, and which I could easily
have multiplied to a greater number, I doubt not but you are
so good a Christian as to return good for evil; and to flatter
my vanity by telling me, that all the godly in Scotland abuse
me for my account of John Knox and the Reformation. I suppose
you are glad to see my paper end, and that I am obliged to
conclude with&mdash;Your humble servant.<a name="FNanchor_58:2_56" id="FNanchor_58:2_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_58:2_56" class="fnanchor">[58:2]</a></p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">London, 28th July, 1759.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Your friend, Mr. Wilson,<a name="FNanchor_59:1_57" id="FNanchor_59:1_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_59:1_57" class="fnanchor">[59:1]</a> called on me two
three days ago when I was abroad, and he left your letter. I
did not see him till to-day. He seems a very modest, sensible,
ingenious man. Before I saw him, I spoke to Mr. A. Millar
about him, and found him very much disposed to serve him. I
proposed particularly to Mr. Millar, that it was worthy of so
eminent a bookseller as he, to make a complete elegant set of
the classics, which might set up his name equal to the
Alduses, Stevenses, or Elzevirs; and that Mr. Wilson was the
properest person in the world to assist him in such a project.
He confessed to me that he had sometimes thought of it; but
that his great difficulty was to find a man of letters, who
could correct the press. I mentioned the matter to Wilson, who
said he had a man of letters in his eye: one Lyon, a nonjuring
clergyman at Glasgow. He is probably known to you, or at least
may be so; I would desire your opinion of him.</p>

<p>Mr. Wilson told me of his machines, which seem very ingenious,
and deserve much encouragement. I shall soon see them.</p>

<p>I am very well acquainted with Bourke, who was much taken with
your book. He got your direction from me, with a view of
writing to you, and thanking you for your present; for I made
it pass in your name. I wonder he has not done it: he is now
in Ireland. I am not acquainted with Jenyns; but he spoke very
highly of the book to Oswald, who is his brother in the board
of trade. Millar showed me, a few days ago, a letter from Lord
Fitzmaurice; where he tells him, that he has carried over a
few copies to the Hague, for presents. Mr. York was very much
taken with it, as well as several others who had read it.</p>

<p>I am told that you are preparing a new edition, and propose to
make some additions and alterations, in order to obviate
objections. I shall use the freedom to propose one; <!-- Page 60 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_60" id="Page_v2_60">[60]</a></span>which, if
it appears to be of any weight, you may have in your eye. I
wish you had more particularly and fully proved that all kinds
of sympathy are necessarily agreeable. This is the hinge of
your system, and yet you only mention the matter cursorily, in
p. 20. Now, it would appear that there is a disagreeable
sympathy, as well as an agreeable. And, indeed, as the
sympathetic passion is a reflex image of the principal, it
must partake of its qualities, and be painful where that is
so. Indeed, <em>when we converse with a man with whom we can
entirely sympathize</em>, that is, where there is a warm and
intimate friendship, the cordial openness of such a commerce
overpowers the pain of a disagreeable sympathy, and renders
the whole movement agreeable. But, in ordinary cases, this
cannot have place. An ill-humoured fellow; a man tired and
disgusted with every thing, always <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ennuié</i>, sickly,
complaining, embarrassed; such a one throws an evident damp on
company, which I suppose would be accounted for by sympathy,
and yet is disagreeable.</p>

<p>It is always thought a difficult problem to account for the
pleasure received from the tears, and grief, and sympathy of
tragedy, which would not be the case if all sympathy was
agreeable. An hospital would be a more entertaining place than
a ball. I am afraid that, in p. 99, and 111, this proposition
has escaped you, or, rather, is interwoven with your
reasonings in that place. You say expressly, "It is painful to
go along with grief, and we always enter into it with
reluctance." It will probably be requisite for you to modify
or explain this sentiment, and reconcile it to your system.</p>

<p>My dear Mr. Smith, you must not be so much engrossed with your
own book as never to mention mine. The Whigs, I am told, are
anew in a rage against me, though they know not how to vent
themselves; for they are constrained to allow all my facts.
You have, probably, seen Hurd's abuse of me. He is of the
Warburtonian school; and, consequently, very insolent and very
scurrilous; but I shall never reply a word to him. If my past
writings do not sufficiently prove me to be no Jacobite, ten
volumes in folio never would.</p>

<p>I signed, yesterday, an agreement with Mr. Millar; where I
mention that I proposed to write the History of England, <!-- Page 61 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_61" id="Page_v2_61">[61]</a></span>from
the beginning till the accession of Henry VII.; and he engages
to give me £1400 for the copy. This is the first previous
agreement ever I made with a bookseller.<a name="FNanchor_61:1_58" id="FNanchor_61:1_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_61:1_58" class="fnanchor">[61:1]</a> I shall execute
this work at leisure, without fatiguing myself by such ardent
application as I have hitherto employed. It is chiefly as a
resource against idleness that I shall undertake this work;
for, as to money, I have enough; and as to reputation, what I
have wrote already will be sufficient, if it be good; if not,
it is not likely I shall now write better. I found it
impracticable (at least fancied so) to write the History since
the Revolution. I am in doubt whether I shall stay here and
execute the work; or return to Scotland, and only come up here
to consult the manuscripts. I have several inducements on both
sides. Scotland suits my fortune best, and is the seat of my
principal friendships; but it is too narrow a place for me;
and it mortifies me that I sometimes hurt my friends. Pray
write me your judgment soon. Are the bigots much in arms on
account of this last volume? Robertson's book has great merit;
but it was visible that he profited here by the animosity
against me. I suppose the case was the same with you. I am,
dear Smith, yours sincerely.<a name="FNanchor_61:2_59" id="FNanchor_61:2_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_61:2_59" class="fnanchor">[61:2]</a></p>

<p>In 1758 and 1759, much alarm was caused throughout Britain by a
threatened invasion from France. Hume seems to have "improved" this
state of matters, in the following letters, imparting wild and
exaggerated news. His writing in such a tone, at such a juncture, is an
example of his entertaining the same contempt for panics as for popular
feeling in other forms. There is no address on the first of the letters.
The second would reach its destination nearly at the same time with the
account of Rodney's destruction of the flat-bottomed boats intended for
the invasion.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"6th July [1739.]</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Ruat</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you for the desire you
express to Miss Elliot of hearing from me; and particularly
your wishing to be informed, by me, of any news that pass. As
soon as I knew, certainly, how to direct to you, I have sat
down to write; and, though the occurrences are no way
extraordinary which I can communicate, they <!-- Page 63 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_63" id="Page_v2_63">[63]</a></span>shall all be
strictly, and literally, and certainly true; and you may
venture to tell them as such to all the idle people that
frequent Buxton.</p>

<p>"This morning, there arrived an express from Admiral Hawke's
fleet, giving an account that the French fleet had sallied out
of Brest, with twenty-four ships of the line, and had engaged
the English fleet, in a desperate and bloody battle, from
morning to night, which ended in a total victory on our side.
There are seven of the French ships sunk and burnt, and four
taken. There are two of our capital ships sunk, and the
admiral's ship was blown up, with its whole company, not one
of whom is saved. Prince Edward, in the Phœnix, behaved to
admiration; but, towards the end of the engagement, an unlucky
cannon ball carried away both his legs, by which it is feared
we shall loose that promising young prince. Our friend, poor
Dr. Blair, would not go below deck, but stood by the prince's
side during the whole engagement, till his head was carried
off by a double-headed shot.</p>

<p>"About three hours after the arrival of this express, there
arrived another from the west, giving an account of the
landing of the French in Torbay, to the number of twenty
thousand foot, and five thousand horse. They believe already,
in London, that they are sixty thousand strong. The panic is
inconceivable. The people in the country are hurrying up to
town; those in the town are hurrying down to the country.
Nobody thinks of resistance. Every one believes the French,
Popery, and the Pretender, to be at their heels.</p>

<p>"What adds to our general confusion is, the discovery of
treachery in our councils. Mr. Pitt is sent to the Tower, for
holding a secret correspondence with the French:&mdash;his ciphers
and letters are taken. Mr. Wood, our friend, (if he can be
said to deserve <!-- Page 64 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_64" id="Page_v2_64">[64]</a></span>that name,) is thrown into a dungeon; and
there will be certain proofs to convict him of that treachery.</p>

<p>"In order to prepare the way for this blow, the perfidious
French had employed somebody to blow up the magazine in the
Tower. I heard the explosion this morning about five o'clock.
All London is covered with rubbish, and stones and brick, and
broken arms. There fell into our back court a shattered
musket, and the bloody leg of a man. I thought the day of
judgment was come when I first heard the explosion, and began
seriously to think of my sins.</p>

<p>"These events will, all of them, make a figure in future
historians; and it is happy for these gentlemen, who are, or
ought to be, very scrupulous with regard to matters of fact,
that they can so well reconcile the true and the marvellous.</p>

<p>"As to private news, there is little stirring; only Dr.
Warburton turned Mahometan, and was circumcised last week.
They say he is to write a book, in order to prove the divine
legation of Mahomet; and it is not doubted but he will succeed
as well as in proving that of Moses. I saw him yesterday in
the Mall with his turban; which really becomes him very well.</p>

<p>"Poor Andrew Millar is declared bankrupt; his debts amount to
above £40,000, and it is said his creditors will not get above
three shillings in the pound. All the world allow him to have
been diligent and industrious; but his misfortunes are
ascribed to the extravagance of his wife, a very ordinary case
in this city.</p>

<p>"Miss &mdash;&mdash;, yesterday morning declared her marriage with Dr.
Armstrong; but we were surprised in the afternoon to find Mr.
Short the optician, come in and challenge her for his wife. It
seems she has <!-- Page 65 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_65" id="Page_v2_65">[65]</a></span>been married privately for some time to both of
them. Her sister has been much more prudent, whom we find to
have confined herself entirely to gallantry, and to have
privately entertained a correspondence with three gallants. I
am, dear Ruat, with great truth, your most sincere friend and
humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_65:1_62" id="FNanchor_65:1_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:1_62" class="fnanchor">[65:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>About the commencement of November, Hume returned to Scotland, for he
writes to Millar on 18th December that he has been six weeks in
Edinburgh. He states, that he is correcting his "History of the
Stuarts;" and says, "I fancy that I shall be able to put my account of
that period of English history beyond controversy. As soon as this task
is finished, I undertake the ancient English history. I find the
Advocates' Library very well provided with books, in this period: but
before I finish, I shall pass a considerable time in London, to peruse
the manuscripts in the Museum."<a name="FNanchor_65:2_63" id="FNanchor_65:2_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:2_63" class="fnanchor">[65:2]</a></p>

<p>On his return he left behind him, to be published in London, the two
volumes of his "History of England, under the House of Tudor," of which
he says in his "own life,"&mdash;"The clamour against this performance was
almost equal to that against the History of the two first Stuarts. The
reign of Elizabeth was particularly obnoxious."</p>

<p>He had now published the whole of that department of his History, from
which his opinions on the later progress of the British constitution can
be derived; and the epoch of this publication calls for some notice of
the manner in which subsequent inquirers have found that he performed
his task.<a name="FNanchor_65:3_64" id="FNanchor_65:3_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_65:3_64" class="fnanchor">[65:3]</a> He was not <!-- Page 66 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_66" id="Page_v2_66">[66]</a></span>like such writers as Clarendon and Brady,
the interested or prejudiced advocate of the crown against <!-- Page 67 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_67" id="Page_v2_67">[67]</a></span>the people;
and we must look for the causes of his erroneous views in what he did
not know, or did not believe, rather than in what he wilfully
misrepresented. In his "Essay on Commerce," published in 1752, we find
him thus foreshadowing the principle on which he was to treat the
History of Britain:&mdash;"Lord Bacon, accounting for the great advantages
obtained by the English in their wars with France, ascribes them chiefly
to the superior ease and plenty of the common people among the former;
<em>yet the government of the two kingdoms was at that time pretty much
alike</em>." This assertion has been satisfactorily proved to be erroneous.
The spirit of credulity in historical inquiry makes out every thing
ancient to be better and greater than its modern representative. The
spirit of scepticism questions whatever is said in favour of antiquity.
The sceptic cannot throw doubt on the existing wonders of modern times.
If one nation is far beyond another in arts, arms, civilization, or
wealth, the facts cannot be denied; but when he looks back into past
ages, the pliability of the evidence admits the influence of the
levelling principle of scepticism, the tendency of which is to make all
mankind seem much alike; and Hume, who would not have ventured to say
that in his own day the constitutions of France and England were very
much alike, considered it but a piece of proper caution to discard as
fallacious the evidence that there was any great difference between them
in former times.</p>

<p>Unquestionably the doubting or inquiring spirit is a valuable quality in
a historian; for the narratives of <!-- Page 68 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_68" id="Page_v2_68">[68]</a></span>human affairs are full of
falsehoods, which it is the philosophical historian's function to
discard. But the sifting will not be satisfactory, if the materials
subjected to it have not been largely and laboriously collected; and the
charge against Hume is, that he applied it to imperfect data. Where the
data are insufficient, credulity and scepticism are merely the
counterparts of each other, and produce erroneous results nearly alike.
Those who proclaimed Bruce, the Abyssinian traveller, to be a liar, for
statements which have now been authenticated, believed in the account
given of a fictitious people, in an impudent forgery, called
Psalmanazer's Formosa, which would not now impose for a moment on any
educated person. Our enlarged knowledge of the matters to be subjected
to sceptical analysis, has now, in both cases, brought us to the right
conclusion.</p>

<p>An inquirer into the structure of the earth, who should know nothing of
its crust but the sandy plains of Germany, would, were he of a sceptical
spirit, discredit all those geological wonders which the most sceptical
of scientific men now believe.<a name="FNanchor_68:1_65" id="FNanchor_68:1_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_68:1_65" class="fnanchor">[68:1]</a> In relation to some parts of the
British constitution, Hume was in the position of such an investigator.
His early prejudice against the study of the law, prevented him from
being fully acquainted with a <!-- Page 69 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_69" id="Page_v2_69">[69]</a></span>science, the knowledge of which is
essential to any man who would clearly develop the progress of our
constitution,&mdash;the common law of England. He did not understand its
stubborn immovable nature, its solid impregnable masonry, against which
the ambitious violence of monarchs, and the fury of popular tumults
raged in vain. From the day when Gascoigne committed Henry V. to prison,
to that when surly tyrannical old Sir Edward Coke argued face to face
with King James against the interference of the prerogative with the
independent authority of his court, those who were the honest
administrators of the common law held that they were no man's servants,
and no man's masters, but the sworn expounders of a settled rule of
action, which no power within the realm could sway. It might be full of
strange conceits, of passages hard to determine, of unreasonable and
often cruel rules: but what this oracle bade them, that were they bound
to do, be the consequences what they might.</p>

<p>To a mere onlooker, this system appeared to be clumsy and barbarous, and
unendowed with that philosophical symmetry which characterized the rival
system of the civil law. It required that one should have a full
knowledge of its massive structure, and passive power of resistance, to
appreciate its value in a country where king, nobles, and common people,
were alike characterized by party spirit, courage, and restless
activity. A philosopher, indulging in a distant contemplation, would at
once prefer the nice philosophical adaptation to the wants of a state,
and the fine logical structure, with which a despotic power, able to
manipulate the laws at its own will, had endowed the system of
Justinian; and if he found that the administrators of the rude common
law waged a determined <!-- Page 70 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_70" id="Page_v2_70">[70]</a></span>war against this philosophical code, his
contempt for the one, and his admiration of the other, would be likely
to be increased. But there is no doubt that the advocates of the common
law were right in resisting the introduction of the pliant principles of
the civilians. If it be true that the common law, and the constitution
which grew along with it, embodied no philosophical principle of
liberty, it is also true that they embodied no philosophical principle
of despotism, such as that which was ready made in the Justinian
legislation. The theories of passive obedience, and the sacredness of
the monarchical character, were strangers to it; and these doctrines, so
attractive to those who profit by them, were introduced by the
civilians. In presence of the unbending operation of the common law, and
dependent on a surly suspicious parliament, the sovereign might yet, if
he were a man of talent and courage, be very powerful and very
tyrannical: but he had none of those attributes through which the
ingenuity of the civilians had divested him of all the moral failings,
so far as they were accompanied with the moral responsibilities of a
human being. He was often a "most dread sovereign:" but it was for these
novel doctrines, the fruit of the reading of the clergy and the
ecclesiastical lawyers, to invest him with the attributes of "sacred
majesty."</p>

<p>The supporters of the common law, and of the old popular rights, strove
to keep the law above the king. Those who drew their constitutional
principles from the civilians and canonists, desired to place the king
above the law. They accomplished their object in name, but not in fact,
by incorporating with the constitutional law those fictions, that the
king never dies, is not responsible, does not require to appear by <!-- Page 71 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_71" id="Page_v2_71">[71]</a></span>his
attorney, suffers no laches, &amp;c. But in reality the old principles which
made the king merely the head of a community, all of whom were subjected
to the law, substantially held its ground; for, in so far as the monarch
was exempted from responsibilities, in the same proportion was he
deprived of any powers which he could exercise otherwise than through a
responsible minister.</p>

<p>There was in Hume a like want of appreciation of the value of
parliamentary forms and privileges, and a corresponding indifference
about their violation. He had not sufficiently studied the Journals of
the Commons, and did not trace the rise and development of that system
of procedure which has protected our own liberties, and afforded a model
for the legislative assemblies of all free nations.<a name="FNanchor_71:1_66" id="FNanchor_71:1_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_71:1_66" class="fnanchor">[71:1]</a> It was in the
Long Parliament, and under the eye of the able men of business who then
held the lead, that this noble system was brought to perfection; but the
reader whose historical information is derived solely from <!-- Page 72 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_72" id="Page_v2_72">[72]</a></span>Hume, knows
little of its value. Thus unconscious of the practical importance of the
rights and privileges of the English people, he did not sympathize with
those who expected alarming consequences from their infringement. He
involved those who put the protection of their legal rights to the issue
of the sword, in the same contemptuous estimate with the fanatics whom
he charged with convulsing the state about religious differences of no
essential moment. In either case the event at issue was of so little
importance in his estimation, that he had small charity for those who
made it a vitally important concern.<a name="FNanchor_72:1_67" id="FNanchor_72:1_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_72:1_67" class="fnanchor">[72:1]</a> But in all these matters we
look back on Hume with the light of later times. To appreciate his
services to constitutional history, we must, while we keep in view the
successful labours of later inquirers, remember how little had been done
by his predecessors. The old chroniclers, such as Hall and <!-- Page 73 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_73" id="Page_v2_73">[73]</a></span>Holingshed,
scarcely ever deign to descend from the pride, pomp, and circumstance of
glorious war, to mention constitutional matters; and perhaps, in an
impartial estimate, it will be admitted that in the gradual progress
towards a better appreciation of what is truly valuable in British
history, no one writer has taken so great a stride as Hume.</p>

<p class="center">"ANECDOTES OF DAVID HUME, ESQ.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>By one who personally knew him.</i></p>

<p>"David Hume was a man of parts, natural and acquired, far
superior to most of mankind; of a benevolent heart, a
friendly, kind disposition, and a real affection for all his
connexions. No man is without his failings; and his great
views of being singular, and a vanity to show himself superior
to most people, led him to advance many axioms that were
dissonant to the opinions of others, and led him into
sceptical doctrines only to show how minute and puzzling they
were to other folk; in so far, that I have often seen him (in
various companies, according as he saw some enthusiastic
person there) combat either their religious or political
principles; nay, after he had struck them dumb, take up the
argument on their side with equal good humour, wit, and
jocoseness, all to show his pre-eminency. For the justness of
these observations, I appeal to his life, wrote by himself,
and published by his friend and admirer, Adam Smith, where you
see he was so chagrined at no notice of, or answer being made
to, his Essays, and was so disappointed, that he proposed to
retire to Saumure, or some other part of France, to be lost to
the unheeding world; and, in short, be a perfect hermit. But,
on being answered by a bishop, on some of his dogmas, and
other favourable circumstances flattering him that he would at
last be conspicuous, he gave up the project, and was first a
companion, for some time, to the Marquis of Annandale; then
librarian to the Advocates here; after that, secretary to
General Sinclair at Turin (who was, under pretence of an
ambassador to his Sardinian Majesty, a spy, as his conduct was
dubious to the allies, against Louis XV.;) afterwards, by
General Conway's interest, secretary to Lord Hertford at
Paris; left there chargé d'affairs; and, finally, one of the
under secretaries of state for about half a year. After which
he settled in Edinburgh for life, and made all his friends and
connexions happy by the possession of so worthy a man.&mdash;Thus
far I have given my real sentiments of the man, and can only
now regret that he was so weak as to write his life in the
style he did.</p>

<p>"I must add, that he was a cheerful and most agreeable
companion, well informed, and who accommodated himself to the
company; and, for all his abstruse learning, was never happier
than in a select company of ladies and friends, and fond to
engage in a party at whist, of which game he was a complete
adept, and, of consequence, successful. He never played deep;
never above a shilling, one, two, or three; and I have known
him come into Edinburgh for some weeks, pay his residence
there, and get a recruit of clothes and necessaries out of his
gains; nay, sometimes to have a pound or two to give in
assistance to a necessitous relation; and carry back to his
brother's house, at Ninewells, the cash he brought with him
from that place, in order to defray the expenses of his visit
to the metropolis. General Scott of Balcomie, who was a good
judge in these matters, was so convinced of his superior skill
at whist, that I was assured he offered David his purse to
gamble at London; and that he would give him £1000 a-year if
he would communicate his winnings. This he refused with
disdain, saying, he played for his amusement; and though
General Scott would give him ten times more per annum, he
would be accessary to no such fraudulent doings.</p>

<p>"It was very remarkable, that, though from study and reading
the purest authors in the English language he learnt to write
in a correct and elegant style, yet, in conversing, he spoke
with the tone, idiom, and vulgar voice of the commonalty in
the Merse or Berwickshire. This, I presume, arose from his
having been greatly, in his early years, about his brother's
house, conversing with servants, &amp;c.; and having no ear
(though a foreign or even a dead language, which he acquired
by grammar and rules, he wrote pointedly,) it was impossible
for him to attain, in speaking, any other dialect of the Scots
than that he caught in his childhood: besides, he had but a
creeping voice, rather effeminate than manly.</p>

<p>"I could give you several anecdotes with regard to him; I
shall content myself with one. One day when he was advancing
some irreligious maxims in a sarcastical style, I said to him,
'L&mdash;&mdash;, David, ye are much altered in your sentiments since
you professed yourself a sincere Roman Catholic, confessed
yourself to the priests, declared yourself a sincere penitent,
got absolution, and even extreme unction.' He was much
offended at this, as he believed none knew, in this country,
that all this had happened to him at Nice. He answered in a
huff, 'I was in a high fever then, and did not know what I
said, or they did with me.' I replied, 'You put me in mind of
Patie Birnie's answer to the minister of Kinghorn, who,
stumbling o'er him in a passage dead drunk, said, 'Ah! Patie,
is this your promise that you would never be fu' again, if the
Lord spared you?'&mdash;'Wow,' quo' Pate, 'I wonder to hear ane of
your honour's sense mind what ony body says in a red raving
fever; I kent naithing of what was ga'en.' David and I, for
years after, were tolerable good friends, but never so cordial
as before. G. N." [These initials are supposed to be those of
George Nichol, M. P.]</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_9:1_6" id="Footnote_9:1_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9:1_6"><span class="label">[9:1]</span></a> Hume was inclined to admire the polity of the Church of
England, on grounds peculiar to himself. The tendency of his remarks on
the wealth and dignity of that establishment, is to hold that heaping
riches and honours on a clergy, by occupying their minds in pomps and
vanities, diverts a certain portion of the spirit of priestcraft from
its natural propensity to subdue or annoy the rest of the community, and
is on the whole a judicious investment of a considerable proportion of
the wealth and honours which may happen to be at the command of a state.
Adam Smith's opinion, on the other hand, was, that the people are best
protected against the influence of priestcraft, by allowing no sect to
have a superiority over others, and by leaving the clergy of different
denominations to expend their zeal in fighting with each other.</p>

being done in two ways, is afforded by comparing Hume's resignation with
that of his venerable predecessor, Ruddiman. The latter is a document of
considerable length, and ends in the following strain:&mdash;"But though I
can be no longer serviceable to the honourable Faculty in that my former
capacity, yet there is one duty still in my power, and which can never
be dispensed with; and that is, that from the deep and most grateful
sense which I shall always retain of your great and manifold favours, I
should earnestly pray to Almighty God for the honour, prosperity, and
flourishing state of your most learned and useful society; that ye may
continue a great ornament to those high courts, of which you are
members; and that in them, and every where else, ye may shine forth with
that splendour and dignity, that unblemished character for justice and
probity, and the faithful discharge of all those duties your honourable
profession has laid upon you, for which you are so remarkable; and which
the superior name and rank you bear in the world, give your country just
ground to expect of you.</p>

<p>"This is the last best testimony and assurance I can give, of my most
sincere gratitude, warm affection, and high regard to the honourable
Faculty; and that I am, now, and always, my much honoured patrons and
masters, your most obliged, most humble, and most dutiful servant,&mdash;</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_23:1_19" id="Footnote_23:1_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23:1_19"><span class="label">[23:1]</span></a> In a work by Dr. John Brown, called, "An Estimate of the
Manners and Principles of the Times," 1757, there is the following
passage:&mdash;"A certain historian, of our own times, bent upon <em>popularity</em>
and <em>gain</em>, published a large volume, and omitted no opportunity that
offered to disgrace religion. A large impression was published, and a
small part sold. The author being asked why he had so larded his work
with irreligion, his answer implied:&mdash;'He had done it that his book
might sell.' It was whispered him, that he had totally mistaken the
spirit of the times;&mdash;that no allurements could engage the <em>fashionable</em>
infidel world to travel through a large quarto; and that, as the few
readers of quartos that yet remain lie mostly among the serious part of
mankind, he had offended his best customers, and ruined the sale of his
book. This information had a notable effect; for a second volume, as
large and instructive as the first, hath appeared; not a smack of
irreligion is to be found in it; and an apology for the first concludes
the whole."&mdash;P. 57.</p>

<p>Dr. Brown's book is said to have been very popular, and to have run to a
seventh edition in a few months. It is rather singular that the edition
marked as the seventh, has precisely the same matter in each page, and
the same number of pages as the first.</p>

convey any associations to the general English reader, who requires to
be told that it is derived from <ins class="greek" title="Epigonoi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Ἑπίγονοι</ins>, or descendants, in
allusion to those of the warriors who had been slain at the first siege
of Thebes; and the main incident of the poem is the subsequent sacking
of that city. It is not difficult for the reader of the better parts of
the Epigoniad to imagine, that he is perusing Pope's translation of
Homer. When an approach was thus made to a model so famous, all was
supposed to have been gained; and it was thought that a work had been
produced which would stand beside the Iliad and the Odyssey. It is
hardly necessary, at the present day, to ask, whether the highest genius
will produce an immortal poem out of the machinery of another age and
nation, and appealing to sentiments which have no response in the habits
or feelings of the people to whom its author appeals? We read the great
national poems of other countries in their own language, because we thus
endow ourselves, as far as it is possible, with the feeling and ideas of
those to whom the poem was addressed. We read spirited translations,
because they are an attempt to represent to us, in our own tongue, that
which is grand in another language; and our interest is like that with
which we view the portrait of a great man. We thus encounter Ulysses,
Agamemnon, and Menelaus in the Iliad, with the interest of excited
curiosity; and those who cannot read the original, are content to make
acquaintance with persons whom a great genius has made so famous, even
through a rude translation. But few cared to meet them reappearing in
Wilkie's imitation; nor, however forcible may be his expressions, or
flowing his versification, do we feel very vividly the horrors of Cacus'
den, and the destructive ire of the Cyclops, or sympathize in the
torments of Hercules, from the Centaur's poisoned robe, when they are
described in the Epigoniad.</p>

laid it aside ever since you was here; I will now, however, finish my
skeleton. It will be hardly that. If, then, you think any thing can be
made of it, and will give yourself the trouble, we may, perhaps, between
us, do a little good, which, I dare say, we shall both think worth a
little pains. If I have any force in the first rude beating out of the
mass, you are best able to give it the elegance of form and splendour of
polish. This will answer my purpose; to labour together in a joint work
to do a little good. I will tell you fairly, it is no more the thing it
should be, and will be, if you undertake it, than the Dantzic iron at
the forge is the gilt and painted ware at Birmingham. It will make no
more than a pamphlet; but you shall take your own time, and make it your
summer's amusement, if you will. I propose it to bear something like
this title:&mdash;'<cite>Remarks on Mr. Hume's late Essay, called The Natural
History of Religion; by a Gentleman of Cambridge, in a Letter to the
Rev. Dr. W.</cite> ' I propose the address should be with the dryness and
reserve of a stranger, who likes the method of the letters on
Bolingbroke's Philosophy, and follows it here against the same sort of
writer, inculcating the same impiety, naturalism, and employing the same
kind of arguments. The address will remove it from me; the author, a
gentleman of Cambridge, from you; and the secrecy in printing from us
both."&mdash;<cite>Letters from a late Eminent Prelate to one of his Friends</cite> , p.
240. In the immediately preceding letter, we find him saying, "I will
trim the rogue's jacket, at least sit upon his skirts, as you will see
when you come hither, and find his margins scribbled over."</p>

<p>Thus were concocted the "Remarks on Mr. David Hume's Essay on the
Natural History of Religion, addressed to the Rev. Dr. Warburton,"
(1757) wherein the candid author, in pursuance of his instructions,
says, "Of my <em>person</em>, indeed, I must have leave to make no discovery;
and to tell you the truth, I have taken such effectual precautions, as
to that particular, that I will venture to say you will never know more
of me than you do at present." The original notes are to be found in the
quarto edition of Warburton's works. Hume says, in his "own life," of
the Natural History of Religion, "Its public entry was rather obscure,
except only that Dr. Hurd wrote a pamphlet against it, with all the
illiberal petulance, arrogance, and scurrility which distinguish the
Warburtonian school. This pamphlet gave me some consolation for the
otherwise indifferent reception of my performance."</p>

principles of the history have been ably impugned, would only be
reminding the reader of many works with which he is probably already
familiar. But among the marked productions of this series, if he desire
to have a calm appreciation of the merits of Hume's historical
criticism, by those who have gone over the same ground, he will peruse
the historical works of Hallam, and the treatises of Dr. Allen,
including his articles in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite> , and his "Inquiry into
the Rise and Growth of the Royal Prerogative." If, however, he wish to
have all Hume's tergiversations sifted and exposed with forensic
acuteness, and the zeal of an able and vigilant prosecutor,&mdash;to have
before him, in short, the whole "case" of the British constitution
against Hume, let him read Brodie's "History of the British Empire." It
will gratify all the admirers of his book to know, that Mr. Brodie is
occupied in the preparation of a new edition of his great work, which
will, no doubt, be marked by all the same qualities which distinguished
the first, increased by farther study and enthusiastic research. It is a
singular incident in literary history, that immediately after the
appearance of the first edition, filled as it is with a prodigious array
of notes and references, the subject was gone over by Godwin in his
"History of the Commonwealth," with but slight reference to Mr. Brodie's
book; but in such a manner, from the structure of his narrative and
otherwise, as to show that he had scarcely any other book before him.</p>

<p>This is not the place for a discussion of Mr. Brodie's charges against
Hume: they are honestly supported by references, and will stand or fall
on their own merits. But there is one instance in which Mr. Brodie's
acuteness has led him farther than every one can follow him. Thus,
speaking of a particular passage of Hume, he says, "he has given the
very words of Perinchief, whom he yet durst not quote; and his
pencil-marks are still at the place in the copy belonging to the
Advocates' Library." This statement, to the effect that there exists
evidence of Hume having read passages which he has designedly avoided
citing, is frequently repeated; and if one would absolutely assure
himself that Hume had read the passages, by reference to the copies of
the books in the Advocates' Library, he finds one or two scores drawn
across the margin with a pencil! The distinguished historical critic,
who has noticed this circumstance, must make some allowance for the
inferior acumen of ordinary readers, if they should fail to discover why
this simple score must of necessity be David Hume&mdash;his mark.</p>

<p>Mr. Brodie's book is particularly valuable as a criticism on Hume's
notions of the old prerogative in relation to the Star Chamber, the
Court of High Commission, Martial Law, Impressments, and Forced Loans.</p>

British Parliament have been adopted by other countries, not from any
partiality towards our systems, but because in this we seem to have
approached abstract perfection; and the framers of codes, after all
endeavours to make forms of like excellence, are obliged to have
recourse to those which have been followed for centuries in St.
Stephen's. In the French Assemblies, ingenuity was frequently exercised
in vain to devise some plan by which, after a series of proposals had
been made, and debated upon, the sense of the meeting in regard to them
might be ascertained and recorded without the record being liable to be
questioned as inaccurate. In the English system, the matter is at once
solved. Each proposed resolution is made and put on record before the
discussion begins, and however many different proposals there may be in
relation to the subject of debate, they must be all put in writing, and
each one must be singly, and without intermixture with the others,
adopted or rejected by a vote of the house.</p>

<p>"Indeed, the prospect of affairs here is so strange and melancholy, as
would make any one desirous of withdrawing from the country at any rate.
Licentiousness, or rather the frenzy of liberty, has taken possession of
us, and is throwing every thing into confusion. How happy do I esteem
it, that in all my writings I have always kept at a proper distance from
that tempting extreme, and have maintained a due regard to magistracy
and established government, suitably to the character of an historian
and a philosopher! I find, on that account, my authority growing daily;
and indeed have now no reason to complain of the public, though your
partiality to me made you think so formerly. Add to this, that the
king's bounty puts me in a very opulent situation. I must, however,
expect that, if any great public convulsion happen, my appointments will
cease, and reduce me to my own revenue: but this will be sufficient for
a man of letters, who surely needs less money both for his entertainment
and credit, than other people."&mdash;<cite>Private Correspondence</cite> , p. 266.</p>

</div>


<p class="section">We have seen, from various indications in Hume's letters to his friends,
that he employed himself occasionally in corrections and alterations of
the published volumes of his History. In these revisals, and especially
in that of the "History of the Stuarts," his alterations were not
limited to the style. He tells us, with a sort of scornful candour, in
his "own life," "Though I had been taught by experience that the Whig
party were in possession of bestowing all places, both in the state and
in literature, I was so little inclined to yield to their senseless
clamour, that in above a hundred alterations which farther study,
reading, or reflection engaged me to make in the reigns of the two first
Stuarts, I have made all of them invariably to the Tory side. It is
ridiculous to <!-- Page 74 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_74" id="Page_v2_74">[74]</a></span>consider the English constitution, before that period, as
a regular plan of liberty."</p>

<p>It was part of his nature, when popular clamour called for the adoption
of a particular course, to turn his steps for that reason the more
distinctly in the opposite direction. He has not exaggerated the extent
or character of his alterations; for an inspection of the various
editions of his History which came under his own revision, shows him, by
turns of expression, structure of narrative, and other gentle
alterations, approaching closer and closer to despotic principles. The
democratic opinions contained in his early essays, have already been
alluded to; and their suppression in subsequent editions, harmonizes
with these variations of the opinions expressed in his History.<a name="FNanchor_74:1_68" id="FNanchor_74:1_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_74:1_68" class="fnanchor">[74:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 75 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_75" id="Page_v2_75">[75]</a></span>There are, however, a very few alterations in an opposite spirit. Thus,
in the following sentence relative <!-- Page 76 --><span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_v2_76" id="Page_v2_76">[76]</a></span>to the proceedings of the House of
Commons regarding the militia, the part in italics is suppressed <!-- Page 77 --><span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_v2_77" id="Page_v2_77">[77]</a></span>in the
later editions. "He [the king] issued proclamations against this
manifest usurpation; <em>the most precipitant and most enormous of which
there is any instance in the English history</em>."</p>

<p>On one incident of some importance in history, he was obliged materially
to change his ground of argument, yet would not alter his original
opinion. During the fervour of the civil wars in 1646, Lord Glamorgan
had in the name of Charles I. concluded a treaty with the confederated
Irish Catholics, by which, on the condition of their aiding the king,
besides other concessions, the Roman Catholic religion was to be
restored to its old supremacy through a great part of Ireland. Ormond,
the lord lieutenant, charged Glamorgan with high treason: but he
produced two commissions from the king. The king disowned the
commissions: but the parliament believed in their genuineness.&mdash;It was
in this shape that the matter <!-- Page 78 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_78" id="Page_v2_78">[78]</a></span>appeared in the first instance before
Hume. In his first edition he accordingly maintained that the
commissions were forgeries; and a long note, explanatory of the grounds
of this belief, is a remarkable instance of a plausible fabric of
historical reasoning, doomed afterwards to fall to pieces by the removal
of its foundation. Before he published his second edition, he received a
letter from the Rev. John Douglas, afterwards Bishop of Carlisle,<a name="FNanchor_78:1_69" id="FNanchor_78:1_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:1_69" class="fnanchor">[78:1]</a>
who was intrusted with the editing of the Clarendon Papers. In this
communication, the reverend gentleman regrets that he cannot send to
Hume a letter written by Glamorgan, describing the method in which the
commissions were actually prepared, and its object; but he gives an
account of the contents of the letter.<a name="FNanchor_78:2_70" id="FNanchor_78:2_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_78:2_70" class="fnanchor">[78:2]</a> Hume could no longer hold
that the commissions were not genuine: but he still maintained Charles
to be guiltless; and though they were unknown to the lord lieutenant,
and bore no attestation of having passed through the proper offices, he
still argued that Glamorgan, in treating with the Irish, though he was
within the letter of his very wide powers, must have exceeded his
instructions; and ingeniously pointed to his work, "The century of
Inventions," in connexion with which Lord Glamorgan is better known, by
his subsequent title of Marquis of Worcester, as the production of a man
who never could have been trusted with powers so extensive as those
which he arrogated.</p>

<p>Besides the variations in political opinion, there were in the
subsequent editions of Hume's History other alterations suggested by
other influences. His opinions were self-formed, and he jealously
protected them in their formation from the influence of other minds; but
in the cultivation of his style he sought assistance with <!-- Page 79 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_79" id="Page_v2_79">[79]</a></span>avidity
from all who could afford it. Hence he appears to have earnestly
solicited the aid of Lyttelton, Mallet, and others, whose experience of
English composition might enable them to detect Scotticisms.</p>

</div>

<p>Before they went to press, his compositions underwent a minute and
rigorous correction. His manuscripts, as the small fac-simile engraved
for these volumes shows, were subjected to a painful revisal. We
sometimes find him, after he has adopted a form of expression, scoring
it out and substituting another; but again, on a comparison of their
mutual merits, restoring the rejected form, and perhaps again discarding
it when he has lighted on a happier collocation of words.<a name="FNanchor_79:1_71" id="FNanchor_79:1_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_79:1_71" class="fnanchor">[79:1]</a> <!-- Page 80 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_80" id="Page_v2_80">[80]</a></span>It is
worthy of remark, that his most brilliant passages are those which bear
the least appearance of <!-- Page 81 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_81" id="Page_v2_81">[81]</a></span>being amended. It is not thence to be inferred
that these passages sprang from his mind in their full symmetry and
beauty: but rather that they had been elaborated, and made ready for
insertion in their proper place, before they were put in writing.</p>

<p>We now resume the correspondence; which will be found to have reference,
among other topics, to the preparation of the History anterior to the
accession of the Tudors.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 22d March, 1760.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You gave me a very sensible pleasure in informing
me so early of the success of 'The Siege of Aquileia'<a name="FNanchor_81:1_72" id="FNanchor_81:1_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_81:1_72" class="fnanchor">[81:1]</a> on
its first representation. I hope it sustained its reputation
after it came into print. I showed Mr. Kincaid your letter;
and he has <!-- Page 82 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_82" id="Page_v2_82">[82]</a></span>published an edition here, of a thousand, which go
off very well. As he had published a pamphlet, this winter,
which he got from you, I told him that I fancied you would be
satisfied with the same terms, which he then agreed to.</p>

<p>"I am very busy, and am making some progress; but find that
this part of English History is a work of infinite labour and
study; which, however, I do not grudge; for I have nothing
better nor more agreeable to employ me. I have sent you a
short catalogue of books, which either are not in the
Advocates' Library, or are not to be found at present. I must
beg of you to procure them for me, and to send them down with
the first ship. Send me also the prices; for I shall be able
to engage the curators of the library to take from me such as
they want at the price.</p>

<p>"Dr. Birch, (to whom make my compliments,) will be so good as
to give you his advice about buying these books; and will tell
you if several of them are collected in volumes, as is often
the case with the old English historians.</p>

<p>"I hope Lord Lyttelton and Mr. Mallet are as busy as I; if so,
we may expect to see their history soon. Please to inform me
what you hear of them. We are informed that Lord Lyttelton is
soon to appear. I wish very much to have the benefit of his
work before I go to the press. Donaldson told me, that Strahan
has, at last, finished the small edition of my Essays, and
that you have shipped his and Kincaid's number. They are
resolved, I find, to dispose of them all in this place. I hope
you have not forgot to send me half a dozen of copies in
sheets, the number which we agreed to on any new edition.</p>

<p>"Your press, in London, has been somewhat barren this winter.
We have had nothing from you but a <!-- Page 83 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_83" id="Page_v2_83">[83]</a></span>good pamphlet or two, and
have, I think, paid the same in kind. Our militia pamphlet was
certainly wrote with spirit; and has been twice reprinted, as
I hear, in London.<a name="FNanchor_83:1_73" id="FNanchor_83:1_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_83:1_73" class="fnanchor">[83:1]</a> I beg to be remembered to Mrs.
Millar; and please tell her that I am very sorry we shall not
have the pleasure of seeing her here this summer. I could wish
her just as much sickness as to make her sensible that
travelling is good for her. My compliments to Dr. Douglas and
Strahan, and to Friend Cummin, who, I hope, sees now a better
prospect of overcoming all his difficulties. I am," &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>The following letter, though it must be already familiar to many
readers, is so clear an exposition of the writer's views on some
branches of historical and biographical literature, that it ought not to
be omitted.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Robertson</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I have frequently thought, and talked with our common friends
upon the subject of your letter. There always occurred to us
several difficulties with regard to every subject we could
propose. The ancient Greek history has several
recommendations, particularly the good authors from which it
must be drawn: but this same circumstance becomes an
objection, when more narrowly considered; for what can you do
in most places with these authors but transcribe and translate
them? no letters or state papers from which you could correct
their errors, or authenticate their narration, or <!-- Page 84 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_84" id="Page_v2_84">[84]</a></span>supply
their defects. Besides, Rollin is so well wrote with respect
to style, that with superficial people it passes for
sufficient. There is one Dr. Lelland, who has lately wrote the
life of Philip of Macedon, which is one of the best periods.
The book, they tell me, is perfectly well wrote; yet it has
had such small sale, and has so little excited the attention
of the public, that the author has reason to think his labour
thrown away. I have not read the book; but by the size, I
should judge it to be too particular. It is a pretty large
quarto. I think a book of that size sufficient for the whole
History of Greece till the death of Philip: and I doubt not
but such a work would be successful, notwithstanding all these
discouraging circumstances. The subject is noble, and Rollin
is by no means equal to it.</p>

<p>I own, I like still less your project of the age of Charles
the Fifth. That subject is disjointed; and your hero, who is
the sole connexion, is not very interesting. A competent
knowledge at least is required of the state and constitution
of the empire; of the several kingdoms of Spain, of Italy, of
the Low Countries, which it would be the work of half a life
to acquire; and, though some parts of the story may be
entertaining, there would be many dry and barren; and the
whole seems not to have any great charms.</p>

<p>But I would not willingly start objections to these schemes,
unless I had something to propose, which would be plausible;
and I shall mention to you an idea which has sometimes pleased
me, and which I had once entertained thoughts of
attempting.<a name="FNanchor_84:1_74" id="FNanchor_84:1_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_84:1_74" class="fnanchor">[84:1]</a> You may observe that, among modern readers,
Plutarch is, in every translation, the chief favourite of the
ancients. Numberless translations and numberless editions have
been made of him in all languages; and no translation has been
so ill done as not to be successful. Though those who read the
originals never put him in comparison either with Thucydides
or Xenophon, he always attaches more the reader in the
translation; a proof that the idea and execution of his work
is, in the main, happy. Now, I would have you think of writing
modern <!-- Page 85 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_85" id="Page_v2_85">[85]</a></span>lives, somewhat after that manner: not to enter into a
detail of the actions, but to mark the manners of the great
personages, by domestic stories, by remarkable sayings, and by
a general sketch of their lives and adventures. You see that
in Plutarch the life of Cæsar may be read in half an hour.
Were you to write the life of Henry the Fourth of France after
that model, you might pillage all the pretty stories in Sully,
and speak more of his mistresses than of his battles. In
short, you might gather the flower of all modern history in
this manner: the remarkable Popes, the Kings of Sweden, the
great discoverers and conquerors of the New World; even the
eminent men of letters, might furnish you with matter, and the
quick despatch of every different work would encourage you to
begin a new one. If one volume were successful, you might
compose another at your leisure, and the field is
inexhaustible. There are persons whom you might meet with in
the corners of history, so to speak, who would be a subject of
entertainment quite unexpected; and as long as you live, you
might give and receive amusement by such a work; even your
son, if he had a talent for history, would succeed to the
subject, and his son to him. I shall insist no farther on this
idea; because, if it strikes your fancy, you will easily
perceive all its advantages, and, by farther thought, all its
difficulties.<a name="FNanchor_85:1_75" id="FNanchor_85:1_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_85:1_75" class="fnanchor">[85:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1760, Macpherson published those "Fragments of Ancient Poetry,
collected in the Highlands of Scotland, and translated from the Gaelic
or Erse language," which, afterwards enlarged, became the celebrated
"Ossian's Poems." Hume took an early interest in this professed
resuscitation of early national literature. He at first doubted the
truth of assertions so unprecedented in literary history, as those by
which the genuineness of the poems was maintained. But there was nothing
to which his heart would have responded with a warmer enthusiasm than
the <!-- Page 86 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_86" id="Page_v2_86">[86]</a></span>discovery, that his ancestors, generally reputed to be but late
accessions to civilization, could look back upon a literature as rich
and great as that which had crowned Greece with the literary supremacy
of the world. Hence, he seems to have, after some time, willingly
yielded to a belief in the genuineness of these poems. His good sense
and sceptical spirit, however, resumed the supremacy, and he afterwards
wrote a very searching though short "Essay on the Authenticity of
Ossian's Poems." It is printed in the Appendix; and thither the whole
correspondence on the subject is transferred, that the reader may peruse
the various pieces in a series. It is probable that the sole reason why
Hume never published this detection, was a kindly feeling to his friend
Dr. Blair, against whom he might not wish to appear in a controversy,
where the critical powers of the latter would be so severely tested. And
yet they stood on perfectly fair ground. Neither Hume nor Blair had any
knowledge of the archæological merits of the question. Each of them
discussed the probable genuineness of the poems on grounds as purely
critical as if they had been brought from Central Africa, instead of
being the alleged literature of a people who are supposed to have at one
time occupied the ground on which Edinburgh is built; and at the time of
that controversy, as at the present day, might be visited on a journey
of fifty miles. In such a state of knowledge, it required great freedom
and decision in criticism to pronounce the poems forgeries. Then, as
now, every genuine Celt protested that he had heard them over and over
again in Gaelic with his own ears; and with this only difference from
the translation, that there were peculiar delicate beauties in the
native Gaelic, which neither Macpherson, nor any other man, was capable
of expressing in English. <!-- Page 87 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_87" id="Page_v2_87">[87]</a></span>In such an unequal controversy, between the
internal evidence of criticism, and the external evidence of broad
assertion, it is singular that no one should have attempted to solve the
question through the faint light which the chronicles of the surrounding
tribes throw on the history of the Celts in Scotland. That knowledge has
now been pretty widely extended; and hence "Ossian's Poems" have been
estimated at their true value, as an embossment of poetical language and
imagery, on the surface of such barren metrical narratives as all
uncivilized and warlike people possess; it has been found that the
structure of the narratives, the characteristic names, the events of
history, and the manners of the times, have been treated with no more
deference, when an alteration was found to suit the purpose of the
"translator."<a name="FNanchor_87:1_76" id="FNanchor_87:1_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_87:1_76" class="fnanchor">[87:1]</a></p>

<p>Intensely occupied with his History anterior to the accession of the
Tudors, we thus find Hume writing to Millar on 27th October:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I have been very busy ever since I came down; and if I keep
my health, shall be able to publish the winter after the next,
or at farthest in the subsequent spring; which I fancy will
serve your purpose well enough. At any rate, this is not a
matter which I can hurry on faster than I am able to satisfy
myself in the execution.</p>

<p>"I am very much pleased with what you tell me, that the
Clarendon Papers have fallen into Dr. Douglas's hands,
especially as Dr. Robertson tells me he intends to publish
them. What my sentiments are on the question you mention, you
may learn from <!-- Page 88 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_88" id="Page_v2_88">[88]</a></span>my letter to the Doctor, which I have sent you
open, and which I beg you to take the trouble of sending; for
I do not know how to direct it."</p>
</div>

<p>Hume wished to amuse himself with mystifying his friends about the
pamphlet above <a href="#Footnote_83:1_73">alluded to</a>, called Sister Peg. The circumstance which
suggested to him the following letter, is said to have been his being
kept in ignorance that his friend Ferguson was the author of the piece.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Carlyle</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 3d February, 1761.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am informed that you have received a letter from
London, by which you learn that the manuscript of Sister Peg
has been traced to the printer's, and has been found to be, in
many places, interlined and corrected in my handwriting. I
could have wished that you had not published this piece of
intelligence before you told me of it. The truth is, after I
had composed that trifling performance, and thought I had made
it as correct as I could, I gave it to a sure hand to be
transcribed, that in case any of the London printers had known
my hand, they might not be able to discover me. But as it lay
by me some weeks afterwards, I could not forbear reviewing it;
and not having my amanuensis at hand, I was obliged in several
places to correct it myself, rather than allow it to go to the
press with inaccuracies of which I was sensible. I little
dreamed that this small want of precaution would have betrayed
me so soon; but as you know that I am very indifferent about
princes or presidents, ministers of the gospel or ministers of
state, kings or keysars, and set at defiance all powers, human
or infernal, I had no other reason for concealing myself, but
in order to try the taste of the public; whom, <!-- Page 89 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_89" id="Page_v2_89">[89]</a></span>though I also
set in some degree at defiance, I cannot sometimes forbear
paying a little regard to. I find that frivolous composition
has been better received than I had any reason to expect, and
therefore cannot much complain of the injury you have done me
by revealing my secret, and obliging me to acknowledge it more
early than I intended. The only reason of my writing to you
is, to know the printer's name, who has so far broke his
engagements as to show the manuscript; for the bookseller
assured my friend to whom I intrusted it, that we might depend
upon an absolute secrecy. I beg my compliments to Mrs.
Carlyle, and am, dear sir," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_89:1_77" id="FNanchor_89:1_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_89:1_77" class="fnanchor">[89:1]</a></p>

<p>We see by the date of the following letter, that Hume varied his city
life with an occasional residence with his brother in Berwickshire.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Ninewells, 29th June, 1761.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;As your professorship of Hebrew is vacant, I
have been applied to in behalf of young Mr. Cummin; and you
are the person with whom I am supposed to have some interest.
But as I imagine you will not put this election on the footing
of interest, I shall say nothing on that head; but shall speak
much more to the purpose by informing you, that I have known
Mr. Cummin for some time, and have esteemed him a young man of
exceeding good <!-- Page 90 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_90" id="Page_v2_90">[90]</a></span>capacity, and of a turn towards literature. He
tells me that he has made the oriental tongues, and
particularly the Hebrew, a part of his study, and has made
some proficiency in them. But of this fact, craving his
pardon, I must be allowed to entertain some doubt; for if
Hebrew roots, as Cowley says, thrive best in barren
soil,<a name="FNanchor_90:1_78" id="FNanchor_90:1_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:1_78" class="fnanchor">[90:1]</a> he has a small chance of producing any great crop
of them. But as you commonly regard the professorship of
Hebrew as a step towards other professorships, in which a good
capacity can better display itself, you will permit me to give
it as my opinion, that you will find it difficult to pitch on
a young man, who is more likely to be a credit to your
college, by his knowledge and industry.</p>

<p>"I am so far on my road to London, where I hope to see you
this season. I shall lodge in Miss Elliot's, Lisle Street,
Leicester Fields; and I beg it of you to let me hear from you
the moment of your arrival."<a name="FNanchor_90:2_79" id="FNanchor_90:2_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_90:2_79" class="fnanchor">[90:2]</a></p>

<p>In 1761, commenced Hume's acquaintance with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>. It
afterwards ripened into a friendship, of which we cannot fully estimate
the nature, without looking not only at the character and position of
the parties, but at some conventional notions of morality, to which Hume
had been, previously, a stranger. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hyppolyte de Saujon, Comtesse de
Boufflers-Rouvel</span>, is not to be confounded with her contemporary the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marquise de Boufflers-Rémencourt</span>, mother of the witty <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chevalier de
Boufflers</span>. The prominent difference between them is but too startlingly
characteristic of the moral atmosphere in which they both lived&mdash;that
the former was mistress of the <!-- Page 91 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_91" id="Page_v2_91">[91]</a></span>Prince of Conti, while the latter is
supposed to have held the same relation to Prince Stanislaus Augustus of
Poland, of whose court she was the great ornament and attraction. A
friendship between a respectable Scotsman of letters and a person in
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers'</span> position, is apt to excite a smile or a frown,
according to the habits or temper of the reader. Hume himself was not
likely to take the most austere view of the matter; and must have felt,
at any rate, that the scandal and even the blame of such connexions must
be greatly affected by the countenance they receive from the society to
which the parties belong. On the vileness of this code of organized
immorality, it would be superfluous, at this hour, to enlarge; but there
is a great difference between those who act up to the standard of a low
social system and those who do the same acts in breach of a higher code.
A Mahomedan who keeps a harem in Constantinople is inferior in his tone
of morality to an English gentleman, of good domestic conduct; but he is
infinitely superior to an Englishman with a harem in Piccadilly.</p>

<p>The lady in question undoubtedly held a very high station in the best
society of Paris; and at that time, and in that country, it is certain
that such attachments, if permanent and decorous, and in a very high
class of society, acquired a more than tolerated respectability. In
1769, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span> speaks of her attachment as one of twenty
years' duration. Early in life, and soon after her marriage, she had
been placed at the court of the Duchess of Orleans: but quarrelling with
that princess, she came under the protection of the Prince of Conti. Of
course, her correspondence bears no mark of her having been subjected to
slights, or of her dreading them; or indeed of any suspicion that there
was any thing in her position to prevent <!-- Page 92 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_92" id="Page_v2_92">[92]</a></span>her from being rigid in her
ideas of virtue, and a teacher of social duties. On her visit to
England, she was well received by the British aristocracy, and was even
honoured by a laudatory growl from Johnson. We find her exchanging
visits with the Marchioness of Hertford, the wife of the English
ambassador, one of the purest of that portion of the English female
aristocracy which had not suffered taint. In one of her letters to Hume,
she describes the death-bed of the prince's mother; speaks of her
displaying the heroism of a grand-daughter of the great <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Condé</span>; and talks
with tearful gratitude of the early kindness of that princess to
herself, and of her attempts to pay the debt by solacing her old age,
and performing to her the last duties which the living receive from each
other. It is in all its spirit the letter of a daughter-in-law.</p>

<p>The prince, though a generous and kind-hearted man, could not be
prevailed on to make her his wife on her husband's death; but when he
died in 1776, he had raised no princess over her head. We shall find
that she made Hume the confidant in her griefs and disappointments, and
the adviser in her difficulties. There is a great air of earnestness and
solicitude in these appeals; and though we cannot help presuming, that a
woman so full in her disclosures to a foreigner, living among a people
of totally different habits and morals, must have distributed a still
larger portion of her confidential revelations nearer home; yet it is
evident that she had much reliance on Hume's counsel, and perhaps he was
not ill fitted for a father-confessor to such a penitent.</p>

<p>The letters of Hume to the countess, have already been for some time
before the English reader.<a name="FNanchor_92:1_80" id="FNanchor_92:1_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_92:1_80" class="fnanchor">[92:1]</a> On <!-- Page 93 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_93" id="Page_v2_93">[93]</a></span>the present occasion some
characteristic extracts will be interwoven with the letters which form
the other side of the correspondence. It is difficult for a native of
this country, with the fullest allowance for the redundancy of the
French laudatory and amicable vocabulary, to estimate at its true value
the ardour of these letters, or to adjust the amount of solid truth and
friendliness represented by such a blaze of ardent expressions. The
correspondence was of the lady's seeking and pursuing. Frequently, when
there is a pause, an impassioned letter from her rouses up the
philosopher; who starts into a sort of artificial excitement, and, when
it is over, sinks into lethargy again. Yet it must be admitted that Hume
acted his part pretty well, and that the fat philosopher was not far
behind the vivacious Frenchwoman. But with him it is visibly all acting;
and there is a total absence of the playful ease which adorns those
letters to his own chosen friends, with whom he was in heart and habits
at ease. In some instances, perhaps, he studied a formal and measured
style, as being more intelligible to a foreigner; and occasionally we
find him offering his correspondent facilities by the adoption of idioms
more French than English; as where he says, "I am truly ashamed, dear
madam, of your having <em>prevented</em> me in breaking our long silence; but
you have <em>prevented</em> me only a few days."<a name="FNanchor_93:1_81" id="FNanchor_93:1_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_93:1_81" class="fnanchor">[93:1]</a></p>

<p>The letter with which the countess opens the correspondence, seems to
have been forwarded to Hume by Lord Elibank's brother, Alexander Murray,
who was then mixing with the Jacobites abroad, and who appears to have
enjoyed a very wide and much varied circle of acquaintance in France. He
says, in a letter of the 18th May, 1761:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The letter forwarded to Hume was as follows:</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame De Boufflers</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Translation.</i>)</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>For a long time, sir, I have struggled with conflicting
sentiments. The admiration which your sublime work has
awakened in me, and the esteem with which it has inspired me
for your person, your talents, and your virtue, have often
aroused the desire of writing to you, that I might express
<!-- Page 95 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_95" id="Page_v2_95">[95]</a></span>those sentiments towards you with which I am so deeply
penetrated.</p>

<p>On the other hand, keeping in view the little value you can
have for my opinion, your want of personal acquaintance with
me, and the reserve and privacy, even, which are suitable to
my sex, I fear being accused of presumption, and of making
myself be known, to my own disadvantage, by a man whose good
opinion I shall always regard as the most flattering, and the
most precious of benefits. Nevertheless, although the
reflections I have made on this subject appeared to have much
force, an irresistible inclination rendered them unavailing;
and I come to add one to the thousand other instances, to
justify the truth of that remark which I have read in your
"History of the House of Stuart,"&mdash;"Men's views of things are
the result of their understanding alone: their conduct is
regulated by their understanding, their temper, and their
passions." Thus, when my reason tells me I ought to be silent,
my enthusiasm prevents me from regarding its voice.</p>

<p>Although a woman, and of no very advanced age, despite the
dissipation attendant on the life one leads in this country,
having always loved reading, there are few good books in any
language, or of any kind, that I have not read, either in the
original, or in translations; and I can assure you, sir, with
a sincerity which cannot be questioned, that I have found none
which, to my judgment, unites so many perfections as your own.
I know no terms capable of expressing what I felt in reading
this work. I was moved, transported: and the emotion which it
caused me is, in some measure, painful by its continuance. It
elevates the soul; it fills the heart with sentiments of
humanity and benevolence; it enlightens the intellect, by
showing that true happiness is closely connected with virtue;
and discovers, by the same light, what is the end, and the
sole end, of every reasonable being. In the midst of the
calamities which, on all sides, surrounded Charles the First,
we see peace and security shining in their brightness, and
accompanying him to the scaffold; whilst trouble and remorse,
the inseparable companions of crime, follow the steps of
Cromwell, even to the throne.</p>

<p><!-- Page 96 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_96" id="Page_v2_96">[96]</a></span>Your book also teaches how the best of things are liable to
abuse; and the reflections which are made on this subject
ought to augment our caution and distrust of ourselves. It
animates with a noble emulation; it inspires love of liberty;
and teaches, at the same time, submission to the government
under which we are obliged to live. In a word, it is a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra
fecunda</i> of morals and instruction, presented in colours so
bright, that we believe we see them for the first time.</p>

<p>The clearness, the majesty, the touching simplicity of your
style delight me. Its beauties are so striking, that,
notwithstanding my ignorance of the English language, they
cannot escape me. You are, sir, an admirable painter: your
pictures have a grace, a nature, an energy, which surpass even
what the imagination can portray.</p>

<p>But how shall I be able to express the effect produced upon me
by your divine impartiality? I would that I had, on this
occasion, your own eloquence in which to express my thought!
In truth, I believed I had before my eyes the work of some
celestial being, free from the passions of humanity, who, for
the benefit of the human race, has deigned to write the events
of these latter times.</p>

<p>I dare only add, that in all which issues from your pen, you
show yourself a perfect philosopher, a statesman, a historian
full of genius, an enlightened politician, a genuine patriot.
All these sublime qualities are so far above the understanding
of a woman, that it is fitting I should say little on the
subject; and I have already great need of your indulgence for
the faults I have committed against discretion and decorum, by
the excess of my veneration for your merit. I entreat this of
you, sir, and, at the same time, the greatest secrecy. The
step I have taken is rather extraordinary. I fear it may
attract blame: and I would be grieved if the sentiment which
has constrained me to it should be misunderstood.</p>

<p>I have the honour to be, sir, your very humble and very
obedient servant,</p>

<p class="authorsc" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hyppolyte De Saujon, Comtesse De Boufflers.</p>

<p>They tell me, sir, you have some idea of coming to France&mdash;to
Paris. I earnestly wish you would execute this <!-- Page 97 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_97" id="Page_v2_97">[97]</a></span>resolution,
and that I may be able to assist in rendering your sojourn
agreeable.</p>

<p><!-- Page 98 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_98" id="Page_v2_98">[98]</a></span>Hume must have been the more than mortal being which his new friend
describes, if he had resisted such an appeal; and he thus wrote in
answer:&mdash;</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtesse de Boufflers</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Edinburgh, 15th May, 1761.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Madam</span>,&mdash;It is not easy for your ladyship to imagine the
pleasure I received from the letter, with which you have so
unexpectedly honoured me, nor the agreeable visions of vanity,
in which, upon that occasion, I indulged myself. I concluded,
and, as I fancied, with certainty, that a person, <!-- Page 99 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_99" id="Page_v2_99">[99]</a></span>who could
write so well herself, must certainly be a good judge of
writing in others; and that an author, who could please a lady
of your distinction, educated in the court of France, and
familiarized with every thing elegant and polite, might
reasonably pretend to some degree of merit, and might presume
to take his rank above the middling historians. But, madam, it
is but fair, that I, who have pretended, in so long a work, to
do justice to all parties and persons, should also do some to
myself; and should not feed my vanity with chimeras, which, I
am sensible, in my cooler moments, can have no foundation in
reason. When I had the pleasure of passing some time in
France, I had the agreeable experience of the polite
hospitality, by which your nation is distinguished; and I now
find, that the same favourable indulgence has appeared in your
ladyship's judgment of my writings. And, perhaps, your esteem
for the entire impartiality which I aim at, and which, to tell
the truth, is so unusual in English historians, has made your
ladyship overlook many defects, into which the want of art or
genius has betrayed me.</p>

<p>In this particular, madam, I must own, that I am inclined to
take your civilities in their full latitude, and to hope that
I have not fallen much short of my intentions. The spirit of
faction, which prevails in this country, and which is a
natural attendant on civil liberty, carries every thing to
extremes on the one side, as well as on the other; and I have
the satisfaction to find, that my performance has alternately
given displeasure to both parties. I could not reasonably hope
to please both: such success is impossible from the nature of
things; and next to your ladyship's approbation, who, as a
foreigner, must necessarily be a candid <!-- Page 100 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_100" id="Page_v2_100">[100]</a></span>judge, I shall always
regard the anger of both as the surest warrant of my
impartiality.</p>

<p>As I find that you are pleased to employ your leisure hours in
the perusal of history, I shall presume to recommend to your
ladyship a late work of this kind, wrote by my friend and
countryman, Dr. Robertson, which has met with the highest
approbation from all good judges.</p>

<p>It is the "History of Scotland" during the age of the
unfortunate Queen Mary; and it is wrote in an elegant,
agreeable, and interesting manner, and far exceeding, I shall
venture to say, any performance of that kind that has appeared
in English. The failings of that princess are not covered
over; but her singular catastrophe is rendered truly
lamentable and tragical; and the reader cannot forbear
shedding tears for her fate, at the same time that he blames
her conduct. There are few historical productions, where both
the subject and execution have appeared so happy.</p>

<p>Some prospect is now given us, that this miserable war between
the two nations is drawing towards a period, and that the
former intercourse between them will again be renewed. If this
happy event take place, I have entertained hopes that my
affairs will permit me to take a journey to Paris; and the
obliging offer, which you are pleased to make me, of allowing
me to pay my respects to you, will prove a new and very
powerful inducement to make me hasten the execution of my
purpose.</p>

<p>But I give your ladyship warning, that I shall, on many
accounts, stand in need of your indulgence. I passed a few
years in France during my early youth; but I lived in a
provincial town, where I enjoyed the advantages of leisure for
study, and an opportunity of learning the language: what I had
imperfectly learned, long disuse, I am afraid, has made me
forget. I have rusted amid books and study; have been little
engaged in the active, and not much in the pleasurable scenes
of life; and am more accustomed to a select society than to
general companies.</p>

<p>But all these disadvantages, and much greater, will be
abundantly compensated by the honour of your ladyship's
protection; and I hope that my profound sense of your obliging
favours will render me not altogether unworthy of it.</p>

<p><!-- Page 101 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_101" id="Page_v2_101">[101]</a></span>I have the honour to be, with the greatest respect, madam,
your ladyship's most obedient and most humble servant.<a name="FNanchor_101:1_85" id="FNanchor_101:1_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:1_85" class="fnanchor">[101:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In return, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame De Boufflers</span> reiterates her compliments, vouches for
her sincerity, and if Hume should fulfil his intention of visiting
France, offers him the use of apartments, saying, that if he accept the
offer it will be an infinite obligation to her; if he refuse it, she
will be vexed but not offended. She will introduce him to her circle of
friends, and do every thing that can tend to make his visit
agreeable.<a name="FNanchor_101:2_86" id="FNanchor_101:2_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:2_86" class="fnanchor">[101:2]</a> In answer to this, Hume finds that the warlike aspect
of affairs will preclude him, in the meantime, from enjoying the society
"of a person so celebrated for her accomplishments by all who have any
knowledge of the court of France."<a name="FNanchor_101:3_87" id="FNanchor_101:3_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_101:3_87" class="fnanchor">[101:3]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Murray's praise of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers'</span> knowledge of the English
language was not misapplied; as the following short letter, and another
of greater length, which will be found a few pages farther on, show.
With a few inaccuracies, they afford a very remarkable instance of
idiomatic acquaintance with our tongue.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I have received, sir, by an unknown hand, the continuation of
your admirable performance. Some little perhaps of the pride
so common in my sex, but much more the desire to contract an
obligation with a man of your merit, and to obtain from him so
valuable a favour, have persuaded me I was indebted to you for
it. 'Tis natural to bend our thoughts towards what is most
advantageous for us, however elevated it may be. The wrong
should be only to believe we deserve it. Then, sir, I think,
that in wishing such a proof of <!-- Page 102 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_102" id="Page_v2_102">[102]</a></span>your kindness, and confessing
in the same time I have no right to pretend to it, I prove my
just opinion of both. I am, sir, your humble servant.</p>

<p class="datelineit">"Paris, May 29, 1762."</p>
</div>

<p>On this, Hume, after observing with ingenious courtesy, that a fairy, a
sylph, or a good genius, who knew his inmost thoughts, must have
anticipated him in sending the copy of his History, continues:&mdash;"But,
madam, what new wonder is this which your letter presents to me? I not
only find a lady, who, in the bloom of beauty and height of reputation,
can withdraw herself from the pleasures of a gay court, and find leisure
to cultivate the sciences; but deigns to support a correspondence with a
man of letters in a remote country, and to reward his labours by a
suffrage the most agreeable of all others, to a man who has any spark of
generous sentiments or taste for true glory. Besides these unusual
circumstances, I find a lady, who, without any other advantages than her
own talents, has made herself mistress of a language commonly esteemed
very difficult to strangers, and possesses it to such a degree as might
give jealousy to us who have made it the business of our lives to
acquire and cultivate it.</p>

<p>"I cannot but congratulate my country on this incident, which marks the
progress made by its literature and reputation in foreign countries."</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>Nearly contemporary with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtesse de Boufflers</span>, comes on the scene a
person with whom we shall hereafter have much concern, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Jacques
Rousseau</span>. He had been living under the protection of the Maréchal de
Luxembourg, in the celebrated hermitage near the castle of Montmorency,
when he published his <!-- Page 103 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_103" id="Page_v2_103">[103]</a></span>"Emile." Highly as he was supported, the wrath of
the clergy prevailed; and a writ of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prise de corps</i> was issued for his
apprehension. It appears that in those strange times of intolerance and
infidelity, there would have been no cause of wonder, if the proceedings
had ended in a capital conviction. With the aid of his friends, the
Luxembourgs and Choiseuls, Rousseau fled the kingdom. On this occasion
he seems to have been thoroughly frightened; and his conduct was
occasioned neither by ostentation, nor perverse discontent. His first
place of refuge was Neufchâtel, one of the Swiss Cantons, of which the
sovereignty was in the house of Brandenburg. Rousseau was thus for a
time one of the illustrious literary men under the protection of
Frederick the Great, though distant from his philosophical capital.</p>

<p>He appealed, however, to a warmer heart than ever beat in the breast of
the conqueror of Prague. The exiled Earl Marischal of Scotland&mdash;a valued
friend of Hume, as of all who became acquainted with him&mdash;was then
Governor of Neufchâtel. Subsequently to his flight from his native
country, for his concern in the rebellion of 1715, when he was a mere
youth, he had suffered a long series of hardships, privations, and
uncertainties; until Frederick saw his value, and purchased his services
at such a rate as a friendless exile might not refuse. Adversity, which
too often hardens the selfishness, and debases the propensities of an
aristocracy driven from home by internal convulsions, had but taught him
how much men are dependent on each other, and had opened his heart to a
wider sympathy with his fellow creatures. His opinions were as tolerant
as his nature was kind; and the fugitive could not have sought an asylum
where he would be more sincerely welcomed. The power <!-- Page 104 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_104" id="Page_v2_104">[104]</a></span>of the king of
Prussia's representative, was, however, not sufficient to protect him
from the people,&mdash;or from himself; and from the time of his flight from
France, those who believed that he sincerely desired a retreat where he
would be safe from all molestation, looked towards Britain. The
following letters from the forfeited earl, at a few months' interval
from each other, chiefly relate to Rousseau. The earl appears to have
been so thoroughly imbued with foreign habits, that he wrote English
with difficulty: most of his letters to Hume are in French, and when he
commences in English, he generally relapses into French. Though so long
employed by the Prussian court, he seems to have been ignorant of
German. It may be observed, however, that French is the vernacular
language of Neufchâtel.</p>

<p>In answer to your question, the Donquixotisme you mention
never entered into my head. I wish I could see you, to answer
honestly all your questions; for though I had my share of
folly with others, yet as my intentions were at bottom honest,
I should open to you my whole budget, and let you know many
things which are perhaps ill-represented, I mean not truly. I
remember to have recommended to your acquaintance Mr. Floyd,
son to old David Floyd, at St. Germains, as a man of good
sense, honour, and honesty. I fear he is dead: he would have
been of great service to you in a part of your History since
1688. Apropos of History, when you see Helvetius, tell I
desired you to inquire of him concerning a certain History. I
fancy he will answer you with his usual frankness. I do
believe Mr. Rousseau will find it impossible to live where he
finds nobody who understands a word of what he says; there
occurs so often occasion, even of trifling things necessary,
that it is a vexation not to understand the language of the
country. I feel it often, though I understand many words of
German, such as <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">kleigh, nigh</span>, <!-- Page 105 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_105" id="Page_v2_105">[105]</a></span><span lang="de" xml:lang="de">nogh, ter migh, ter

thinks good, or rather, as some folks think, for having
displeased persons in great power, who attributed to him what
he never meant, came here to seek retreat, which I readily
granted; and the king of Prussia not only approved of my so
doing, but gave me orders to furnish him his small
necessaries, if he would accept them; and though that king's
philosophy be very different from that of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Jacques</span>, yet he
does not think that a man of an irreproachable life is to be
persecuted because his sentiments are singular. He designs to
build him a hermitage with a little garden, which I find he

persecute him: he is pestered with anonymous letters. This is

doubt not, conformable to the laws of the kingdom,) but
nevertheless rigorous, has decreed the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">prise de corps</i>; and
it is said that, if he had not taken to flight, he would have
been condemned to death. I can scarcely think they could have
proceeded so far against him as a stranger; but, be that as it
may, it would have been imprudent in him to remain in France
under such circumstances. He has therefore departed, uncertain
what asylum he will choose. I have advised him to go to
England, promising him letters of recommendation to you, and
other friends. I fulfil my promise, and I cannot, in my
opinion, choose for him, in all Europe, a protector more
respectable by his position, and more to be commended for his
humanity. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Rousseau</span> is known to the greater part of the
people in this country for an eccentric man. This epithet,
according to its true signification, is most justly applied to
him; for he differs, in many respects, in his modes of acting
and thinking, from the men of his day. He has an upright
heart, a noble <!-- Page 107 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_107" id="Page_v2_107">[107]</a></span>and disinterested soul. He dreads every
species of dependence, and consequently would have preferred
being in France, gaining his subsistence by copying music, to
receiving benefits even from his best friends, who are anxious
to make up for his misfortunes. This delicacy may appear
excessive, but it is not criminal, and it even augurs elevated
sentiments. He flies from intercourse with the world; he feels
pleasure only in solitude. This partiality for retirement has
made him enemies. The self-love of those who court him is
wounded by his rebuffs; but notwithstanding such apparent
misanthropy, I do not believe you will find any where, a man
more gentle, more humane, more compassionate to the sorrows of
others, and more patient under his own. In short, his virtue
appears so pure, so contented, so equal, that, until now,
those who hated him could find only in their own heart reasons
for suspecting him. As for me, with appearances so much in his
favour, I would rather be deceived than doubt his sincerity.</p>

<p>From the opinion that I have of him, sir, he has been judged
worthy of being known to you; and in procuring him this
honour, I believe I give the most marked proof of my
consideration for him.<a name="FNanchor_107:1_89" id="FNanchor_107:1_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_107:1_89" class="fnanchor">[107:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 108 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_108" id="Page_v2_108">[108]</a></span>To this Hume made answer in the postscript of the letter cited above.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"P.S.&mdash;So far I had wrote in answer to your ladyship's of the
29th of May, when I was again honoured with yours of the 14th
of June. Good God! madam, how much I regret my being absent
from London on this occasion, which deprives me of the
opportunity of showing in person my regard for your
recommendation, and my esteem, I had almost said veneration,
for the virtue and genius of M. Rousseau. I assure your
ladyship there is no man in Europe of whom I have entertained
a higher idea, and whom I would be prouder to serve; and as I
find his reputation very high in England, I hope every <!-- Page 109 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_109" id="Page_v2_109">[109]</a></span>one
will endeavour to make him sensible of it by civilities, and
by services, as far as he will accept of them. I revere his
greatness of mind, which makes him fly obligations and
dependence; and I have the vanity to think, that through the
course of my life I have endeavoured to resemble him in those
maxims.</p>

<p>"But as I have some connexions with men of rank in London, I
shall instantly write to them, and endeavour to make them
sensible of the honour M. Rousseau has done us in choosing an
asylum in England. We are happy at present in a king who has a
taste for literature; and I hope M. Rousseau will find the
advantage of it, and that he will not disdain to receive
benefits from a great monarch, who is sensible of his merit. I
am only afraid that your friend will find his abode in England
not so agreeable as may be wished, if he does not possess the
language, which I am afraid is the case: for I never could
observe in his writings any marks of his acquaintance with the
English tongue."<a name="FNanchor_109:1_91" id="FNanchor_109:1_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_109:1_91" class="fnanchor">[109:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>From these communications, Hume derived the notion that Rousseau had
immediately proceeded to London. The following paragraph, in a letter
from Elliot, indicates the nature of the inquiries pursued under this
supposition.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As soon as I received your letter, I applied to Mr.
Home, who had also heard from you by the same post, and
desired him to make all possible inquiry after M. Rousseau. If
he be in London we shall certainly find him out; and I need
not assure you, that both on account of his own merit, and
your recommendation, I shall not fail to show him all the
attention in my power. I should doubt, <!-- Page 110 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_110" id="Page_v2_110">[110]</a></span>from the known
character of the man, whether he would accept a pension if it
could be procured for him; and should rather apprehend that,
though this government will protect and tolerate the boldness
of his pen, yet it will hardly reward it. Rousseau is not the
only man of genius, the singularity of whose opinions has
intercepted the rewards due to the superiority of his talents.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In the supposition that he had passed over to England, Hume addressed a
letter to Rousseau, as then in London, which was answered by the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chien
de Diogène</span>, as Voltaire called him, from his retreat in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neufchâtel</span>, on
19th February, 1763. He says he has just received the letter, regrets
that he should have made the mistake of trusting himself among his own
countrymen, who have treated him with insult and outrage, instead of
seeking the hospitable shores of Britain. He does something like justice
to the kindness of Lord Marischal, in the midst of his general mordacity
and discontent; and he praises the wide views, the wonderful
impartiality, the genius of Hume, which would raise him so far above the
rest of his kind, did not the goodness of his heart bring him nearer to
their level.<a name="FNanchor_110:1_92" id="FNanchor_110:1_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_110:1_92" class="fnanchor">[110:1]</a></p>

<p>The following letter from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>, written in English, had
been received in the meantime.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">July 30.</p>

<p>How difficult it is, sir, for one very far from being
insensible to reputation, to refuse the praises of a man,
whose sincerity and admirable talents render them so valuable.
But in regard to veracity, and perhaps more to my true
<!-- Page 111 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_111" id="Page_v2_111">[111]</a></span>interest, I am obliged to acknowledge, I stand a great
distance, for internal or external accomplishments, from the
favourable opinion you have taken of me, whether, in
consulting the noble sentiments which ever inspire you with
sublime ideas, whether in hearkening to some of your
countrymen, disposed to indulgence towards me, by my
well-known inclination for their country.</p>

<p>Perhaps, sir, I confess it with ingenuity, had I been doomed
to be never personally acquainted with you, I should not have
generosity enough to correct your judgment of me. But in this
particular occasion, as in all other, according to my humble
opinion, right and good are closely united. What a shame
indeed for me, and disappointment for you, in place of the
object your imagination has adorned with such shining
qualifications, to find a person to whom Nature has granted
but indifferent ones. A great part of my youth is over. Some
delicacy in features, mildness and decency in countenance, are
the only exterior advantages I can boast of; and as for
interior, common sense, improved a little by early good
reading, are all I possess. My knowledge of the English
language also is confined, as you can easily perceive. I have,
indeed, acquired without assistance that which I know of it;
but if I am entitled to some elegancy, I owe it to the
repeated readings of your admirable works.</p>

<p>After this true picture of myself, in which I have struggled
to exert the noble impartiality and candour which shine in all
your writings, my first care is, sir, to acknowledge the
infinite obligations you have conferred upon me by your kind
letter. I have translated the P. S. to send it to my friend.
The esteem of such a man must be the best balm for his wounded
heart. But I am afraid he will not accept the glorious support
you are so good as to offer him. I fear that the weight of his
calamities has impaired his health, and he cannot sustain the
fatigues of a long journey. In his last letter to me, he
expresses a resolution never to see England upon that account.
Nevertheless, I am informed since, that new persecutions may
possibly determine him to alter his mind. An irregular trial
has deprived him of the natural rights in his own country. The
commonwealth of Berne, from the example of Geneva and France,
<!-- Page 112 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_112" id="Page_v2_112">[112]</a></span>has burnt his book, and he has been reduced to leave in a
hurry the asylum that a friend had proffered him there. Such
are the grievous misfortunes of this virtuous and unhappy man.
I pity, I love him, and wish earnestly to sooth the sorrows
under which he labours. Nevertheless, sir, I would fain also
vindicate the honour of my nation in the eyes of so good a
judge as you are. The reflection you cast upon it gives
uneasiness; but mistrusting greatly my capacity, I fear to
betray the cause I would defend by an enterprise so unequal to
my force. I dare only to say, that your happy country has not
attained in a moment the perfect constitution which gives us
admiration. All convenient and well-calculated laws are not
framed at once; and those most exceptionable, while they
stand, deserve obedience and respect.</p>

<p>Is it possible, sir, that this late unhappy event could
deprive of the honour of your presence, a country filled with
your fervent admirers, and where every one will endeavour to
outdo each other in expressing the veneration and regard you
so justly deserve? I hope you will not keep this severe
resolution. If we want a liberty you think an advantage, 'tis
a reason to pity, and not to punish us. Besides, your case and
that of M. Rousseau, though both foreigners in France, are
quite different. Few days before I received your letter, I
heard that it was a friend of mine who has favoured me with
your last performance. I am infinitely obliged to him for this
gracious gift, and to you, sir, for your good intention.</p>

<p>But what strange a creature will you think me, to venture to
point a mistake in a work so perfect? In several parts of the
first volume our countryman Godefroy of Bouillon is named
Godefroy de Boulogne. You have reasons, perhaps, for the
alteration, and I am ready to submit to them. I would only
express my doubts: I hope you will excuse this freedom.</p>

<p>Since I have gone so far, permit me, sir, to ask your opinion
upon the last book of M. Rousseau. I should be very glad to
have my judgment of it confirmed or mended by yours. Nothing
would be wanting to my satisfaction, if in the same letter,
where you could grant me the favour I <!-- Page 113 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_113" id="Page_v2_113">[113]</a></span>wish for, I was assured
you had renewed the project to come here, and that you would
speedily execute it. I am, sir, with esteem, gratitude, and,
permit me to add, friendship, your most humble servant.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In answer to this letter, Hume says that he had at first regarded it as
a sort of challenge to answer it in French, but that he had given up the
attempt as an unequal contest with "the sole instance of a foreigner,
not habituated to our tongue, who has, from reading alone, become so
entirely mistress of it." He then gives an account of the letter he had
received from Lord Marischal, and says of Rousseau's refusal of the
kindnesses proferred to him,&mdash;"Rousseau, with his usual dignity, refused
all these gratuities, though at the same time he desired my lord to
learn from me, whether it were possible for him to gain from the London
booksellers as much money as would suffice for his maintenance; and this
recompense, being the fruit of his own industry, he would have no
scruple to accept of. I think this instance of conduct a kind of
phenomenon in the republic of letters, and one very honourable for M.
Rousseau. One is only apt to wish that he could practise this virtue
with less hardship and difficulty; though we must also confess, that the
difficulty adds to the lustre of it. I have heard, that the circumstance
which deterred him from coming over to England, as he first intended,
was a harsh reflection, which he threw out on the people in his
'Treatise of Education:' if this was his motive, I am persuaded that he
would find it a vain fear, and that every one would rather have been
anxious to show respect to his merit."<a name="FNanchor_113:1_93" id="FNanchor_113:1_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_113:1_93" class="fnanchor">[113:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 114 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_114" id="Page_v2_114">[114]</a></span>He then obeys the mandate to criticise the "Emile."</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>You deign, madam, to ask my opinion of the new performance of
M. Rousseau. I know that it becomes me better to form my
judgment upon yours; but in compliance with your commands, I
shall not make a secret of my sentiments. All the writings of
that author appear to me admirable, particularly on the head
of eloquence; and if I be not much mistaken, he gives to the
French tongue an energy, which it scarce seems to have reached
in any other hands. But as his enemies have objected, that
with this domineering force of genius there is always
intermingled some degree of extravagance, it is impossible for
his friends altogether to deny the charge; and were it not for
his frequent and earnest protestations to the contrary, one
would be apt to suspect, that he chooses his topics less from
persuasion, than from the pleasure of showing his invention,
and surprising the reader by his paradoxes. The "Treatise of
Education," as it possesses much of the merit, seems also
exposed to the faults of his other performances; and as he
indulges his love of the marvellous even in so serious and
important a subject, he has given a pledge to the public that
he was in earnest in all his other topics. If I dared to
object any thing to M. Rousseau's eloquence, which is the
shining side of his character, I should say, that it was not
wholly free from the defect sometimes found in that of the
Roman orator; and that their great talent for expression was
apt to produce a prolixity in both. This last performance
chiefly is exposed to this objection; and I own, that though
it abounds in noble and shining passages, it gave me rather
less pleasure than his former writings. However, it carries
still the stamp of a great genius; and, what enhances its
beauty, the stamp of a very particular genius. The noble pride
and spleen and indignation of the author bursts out with
freedom in a hundred places, and serves fully to characterize
the lofty spirit of the man.</p>

<p>When I came to peruse that passage of Mons. Rousseau's
Treatise, which has occasioned all the persecution against
him, I was not in the least surprised that it gave offence.
<!-- Page 115 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_115" id="Page_v2_115">[115]</a></span>He has not had the precaution to throw any veil over his
sentiments; and as he scorns to dissemble his contempt of
established opinions, he could not wonder that all the zealots
were in arms against him. The liberty of the press is not so
secured in any country, scarce even in this, as not to render
such an open attack of popular prejudices somewhat
dangerous.<a name="FNanchor_115:1_94" id="FNanchor_115:1_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:1_94" class="fnanchor">[115:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In 1761, Dr. Blair communicated to Hume the sermon by Dr. Campbell,
which, when subsequently expanded, became the "Dissertation on
Miracles," already referred to.<a name="FNanchor_115:2_95" id="FNanchor_115:2_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_115:2_95" class="fnanchor">[115:2]</a> On this occasion, Hume wrote in
the following terms to Dr. Blair:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have perused the ingenious performance, which
you was so obliging as to put into my hands, with all the
attention possible; though not perhaps with all the
seriousness and gravity which you have so frequently
recommended to me. But the fault lies not in the piece, which
is certainly very acute; but in the subject. I know you will
say, it lies in neither, but in myself alone. If that be so, I
am sorry to say that I believe it is incurable.</p>

<p>"I could wish that your friend had not chosen to appear as a
controversial writer, but had endeavoured to establish his
principles in general, without any reference to a particular
book or person; though I own he does me a great deal of
honour, in thinking that any thing I have wrote deserves his
attention. For besides many inconveniences which attend that
kind of writing, I see it is almost impossible to preserve
decency and good manners in it. This author, for instance,
says sometimes obliging things of me, <!-- Page 116 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_116" id="Page_v2_116">[116]</a></span>much beyond what I can
presume to deserve, and I thence conclude that in general he
did not mean to insult me; yet I meet with some other
passages, more worthy of Warburton and his followers, than of
so ingenious an author.</p>

<p>"But as I am not apt to lose my temper, and would still less
incline to do so with a friend of yours, I shall calmly
communicate to you some remarks on the argument, since you
seem to desire it. I shall employ very few words, since a hint
will suffice to a gentleman of this author's penetration."</p>
</div>

<p>This is followed by a particular examination of some parts of Dr.
Campbell's work, which may be perused to most advantage in conjunction
with the Dissertation itself, along with which the letter is generally
printed. He then says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I could wish your friend had not denominated me an infidel
writer, on account of ten or twelve pages, which seem to him
to have that tendency, while I have wrote so many volumes on
history, literature, politics, trade, morals, which, in that
particular at least, are entirely inoffensive. Is a man to be
called a drunkard, because he has been seen fuddled once in
his lifetime?"<a name="FNanchor_116:1_96" id="FNanchor_116:1_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_116:1_96" class="fnanchor">[116:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 117 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_117" id="Page_v2_117">[117]</a></span>The letter terminates with a recommendation which accounts for the
absence of all observations on religious topics in the correspondence
between Blair and Hume: while it shows that their intercourse had not
always excluded discussions of such a character.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"Having said so much to your friend, who is certainly a very
ingenious man, though a little too zealous for a philosopher,
permit me also the freedom of saying a word to yourself.
Whenever I have had the pleasure to be in your company, if the
discourse turned upon any common subject of literature, or
reasoning, I always parted from you both entertained and
instructed. But when the conversation was diverted by you from
this channel towards the subject of your profession; though I
doubt not but your intentions were very friendly towards me, I
own I never received the same satisfaction: I was apt to be
tired, and you to be angry. I would therefore wish, for the
future, whenever my good fortune throws me in your way, that
these topics should be forborne between us. I have long since
done with all inquiries on such subjects, and am become
incapable of instruction; though I own no one is more capable
of conveying it than yourself. After having given you the
liberty of communicating to your friend what part of this
letter you think proper, I remain, sir," &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p>Hume afterwards wrote the following letter on the same subject:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><!-- Page 118 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_118" id="Page_v2_118">[118]</a></span><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Campbell</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"January 7, 1762.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;It has so seldom happened that controversies in
philosophy, much more in theology, have been carried on
without producing a personal quarrel between the parties, that
I must regard my present situation as somewhat extraordinary,
who have reason to give you thanks for the civil and obliging
manner in which you have conducted the dispute against me, on
so interesting a subject as that of miracles. Any little
symptoms of vehemence, of which I formerly used the freedom to
complain, when you favoured me with a sight of the manuscript,
are either removed or explained away, or atoned for by
civilities, which are far beyond what I have any title to
pretend to. It will be natural for you to imagine, that I will
fall upon some shift to evade the force of your arguments, and
to retain my former opinion in the point controverted between
us; but it is impossible for me not to see the ingenuity of
your performance, and the great learning which you have
displayed against me.</p>

<p>"I consider myself as very much honoured in being thought
worthy of an answer by a person of so much merit; and as I
find that the public does you justice with regard to the
ingenuity and good composition of your piece, I hope you will
have no reason to repent engaging with an antagonist, whom,
perhaps, in strictness, you might have ventured to neglect. I
own to you, that I never felt so violent an inclination to
defend myself as at present, when I am thus fairly challenged
by you, and I think I could find something specious at least
to urge in my defence; but as I had fixed a resolution, in the
beginning of my life, always <!-- Page 119 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_119" id="Page_v2_119">[119]</a></span>to leave the public to judge
between my adversaries and me, without making any reply, I
must adhere inviolably to this resolution, otherwise my
silence on any future occasion would be construed an inability
to answer, and would be matter of triumph against me."<a name="FNanchor_119:1_97" id="FNanchor_119:1_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:1_97" class="fnanchor">[119:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He then, in the passage already cited,<a name="FNanchor_119:2_98" id="FNanchor_119:2_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_119:2_98" class="fnanchor">[119:2]</a> describes the occasion on
which the "Theory of Miracles" was suggested to him.</p>

<p>In answer to this, there is a letter by Campbell, in which he endeavours
to rival his opponent in candour, politeness, and gentlemanlike feeling.
The happy courtesy with which he apologizes for the occasionally
irascible tone of his essay, shows that the retired northern divine
possessed in no small degree the qualities that might have adorned a
more showy station.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Campbell</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">25th June, 1762.</p>

<p>The testimony you are pleased to give in favour of my
performance, is an honour of which I should be entirely
unworthy, were I not sensible of the uncommon generosity you
have shown in giving it. Ever since I was acquainted with your
works, your talents as a writer have, notwithstanding some
differences in abstract principles, extorted from me the
highest veneration. But I could scarce have thought that, in
spite of differences of a more interesting nature, even such
as regard morals and religion, you could ever force me to love
and honour you as a man. Yet no religious prejudices (as you
would probably term them,) can hinder me from doing justice to
that goodness and candour, which appear in every line of your
letter.</p>

<p><!-- Page 120 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_120" id="Page_v2_120">[120]</a></span>
It would be in vain to dissemble the pleasure which it gives
me, that I am thought to have acquitted myself tolerably in a
dispute with an author of such acknowledged merit. At the same
time, it gives me real pain, that any symptoms of vehemence
(which are not so easily avoided in disputation as one would
imagine,) should give so generous an adversary the least
ground of complaint. You have (if I remember right, for I have
not the book here,) in the appendix to the third volume of
your "Treatise on Human Nature," apologized for using
sometimes the expressions&mdash;'Tis certain, 'Tis evident, and the
like. These, you observe, were in a manner forced from you by
the strong, though transient light in which a particular
object then appeared, and are therefore not to be considered
as at all inconsistent with the general principles of
scepticism which are maintained in the Treatise. My apology is
somewhat similar. There is in all controversy a struggle for
victory, which I may say compels one to take every fair
advantage that either the sentiments or the words of an
antagonist present him with. But the appearances of asperity
or raillery, which one will be thereby necessarily drawn into,
ought not to be constructed as in the least affecting the
habitual good opinion, or even the high esteem, which the
writer may nevertheless entertain of his adversary.</p>

sentimens contraires. L'admiration que me cause votre sublime ouvrage,
et l'estime qu'il m'inspire pour votre personne, vos talents, et votre
vertu, m'ont fait naître souvent le désir de vous écrire, pour vous
exprimer les sentimens dont je suis profondément pénétrée. D'un autre
côté, considérant que je vous suis inconnue, le peu de prix que doit
avoir mon suffrage, la réserve et l'obscurité même qui convient à mon
sexe: j'ai craint d'être accusée de présomption, et de me faire
connoître à mon désavantage, d'un homme de qui je regarderai toujours la
bonne opinion comme le bien le plus flatteur et le plus précieux.
Néanmoins, puisque les réflexions que j'ai faites à cet égard ne
paroissent avoir beaucoup de force, un penchant irrésistible les rend
infructueuses, et je vais ajouter mon exemple à mille autres, pour
justifier la vérité de cette remarque que j'ai lue dans votre histoire
de la Maison de Stuard</span>,&mdash;"Men's views of things are the result of their
understanding alone; their conduct is regulated by their understanding,
their temper, and their passions,"&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">puisque quand ma raison me dit que

traductions; et je puis vous assurer, monsieur, avec une sincérité qui
ne doit pas vous être suspecte, que je n'ai trouvé aucun qui réunit à
mon jugement, autant de perfections que le vôtre. Je ne sais point de
termes qui puissent vous rendre ce que j'aprouve en lisant cet ouvrage.
Je me suis attendrie, transportée, et l'émotion qu'il me cause est en
quelque façon pénible par sa continuité. Il élève l'âme, il remplit le
cœur de sentimens d'humanité et bienfaisance. Il éclaire l'esprit, et
en lui montrant la véritable félicité intimement liée à la vertu, il lui
découvre par le même rayon le seul et unique but de tout être
raisonnable. Au milieu des calamités qui environnent de toutes parts le
Roi Charles Premier, l'on voit la paix et la sérénité briller avec éclat
et l'accompagner sur l'échafaud; tandis que le trouble et les remords,
cortége inséparable du crime, suivent les pas de Cromwell et s'asseyent
sur le trône avec lui. Votre livre apprend encore combien l'abus est
voisin des meilleures choses, et les réflexions qu'il fait faire à ce
sujet, doit [doivent] augmenter la vigilance et la défiance de soi-même.
Il anime d'une noble émulation, il inspire l'amour de la liberté, et
instruit en même tems à la soumettre au gouvernement sous lequel on est
obligé de vivre. En un mot c'est un <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">terra fecunda</i> de morale et

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Jean Jacques Rousseau, citoyen de Genève, et auteur de plusieurs écrits
qui vous sont vraisemblablement connus, vient de composer un Traité sur
l'Education, en quatre volumes, où il expose plusieurs principes
contraires aux nôtres, tant sur la politique, que sur la religion. Comme
nous ne jouissons pas ici de la liberté de la presse, le Parlement par
un arrêt, juste, s'il est comme je n'en doute pas conforme aux lois du
royaume, mais néanmoins rigoureux, l'a décrété de prise de corps, et
l'on prétend que s'il n'avoit pas pris la fuite, il auroit été condamné
à la mort. J'ai de la peine à croire qu'on eût pu aller si loin sur la
qualité d'étranger. Mais quoi qu'il en soit, il eut été imprudent de
lui, de rester en France dans de pareilles circonstances. Il est donc
parti, incertain quel asile il choisiroit. Je lui ai conseillé de se
retirer en Angleterre, lui promettant des lettres de recommendation pour
vous, Monsieur, et pour d'autres personnes de mes amis. Je m'acquitte de
ma promesse, et je ne puis pas à mon avis lui choisir dans tout
l'Europe, un protecteur plus respectable par ses liaisons, et plus
recommendable par son humanité. M. Rousseau passe chez la plupart des
gens en ce pays pour un homme singulier. A prendre cette épithète selon
la vraie signification, elle lui est justement donnée, car il diffère, a
beaucoup d'égards, de la façon d'agir et de penser des hommes du jour.
Il a le cœur droit, l'âme noble et désintéressée. Il craint toute
espèce de dépendance, et par cette raison il a mieux aimé, étant en
France, gagner sa vie en copiant de la musique, que de recevoir les
bienfaits de ses meilleurs amis, qui s'empressoient de réparer sa
mauvaise fortune. Cette délicatesse peut paroître excessive, mais elle
n'a rien de criminelle, et même elle suppose des sentimens élevés. Il
fuit le commerce du monde, il ne se plaît que dans la solitude, ce goût
pour la retraite lui a fait des ennemis. L'amour propre de ceux qui
l'ont recherché s'est trouvé blessé de ses refus. Mais malgré sa
misanthropie apparente, je ne crois pas qu'il y ait nulle part, un homme
plus doux, plus humain, plus compâtissant aux peines des autres, et plus
patient dans les siennes, en un mot, sa vertu paroît si pure, si
contente, si uniforme, que, jusqu'à, présent, ceux qui le haïssent,
n'ont pas trouvé que dans leur propre coeur des raisons pour le
soupçonner. Pour moi, avec des apparences aussi avantageuses, j'aimerois
mieux en être trompé que de me défier de sa sincérité.</p>

seems appropriate to this passage. "He never failed, in the midst of any
controversy, to give its due praise to every thing tolerable that was
either said or written against him. One day that he visited me in
London, he came into my room laughing and apparently well pleased. 'What
has put you into this good humour, Hume?' said I. 'Why man,' replied he,
'I have just now had the best thing said to me I ever heard. I was
complaining in a company where I spent the morning, that I was very ill
treated by the world, and that the censures put upon me were hard and
unreasonable. That I had written many volumes, throughout the whole of
which there were but a few pages that contained any reprehensible
matter, and yet that for those few pages, I was abused and torn to
pieces.' 'You put me in mind,' said an honest fellow in the company,
whose name I did not know, 'of an acquaintance of mine, a notary public,
who having been condemned to be hanged for forgery, lamented the
hardship of his case; that after having written many thousand
inoffensive sheets, he should be hanged for one line.'" <cite>Hardy's Memoirs

<p class="section">In 1762 there was published, in two quarto volumes, the "History of
England, from the Invasion <!-- Page 121 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_121" id="Page_v2_121">[121]</a></span>of Julius Cæsar, to the Accession of Henry
VII." The farther back we proceed from those periods of which a full
narrative of historical events is preserved by contemporary chroniclers,
into those more obscure ages when even the lines of kings are hardly
preserved, and fragments of laws, or of long obsolete literature, and
antiquarian relics, are the historian's only guide, the less
satisfactory is Hume's history, when compared with other historical
works. The earliest part is thus the least valuable. He had here,
however, to encounter difficulties which we are only at this day able to
estimate, in the absence of those materials which the industry of
antiquaries has lately brought to light, to so great an extent, as
almost necessarily to supersede Hume's "History of England" during the
early ages, as a source of historical knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_121:1_99" id="FNanchor_121:1_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_121:1_99" class="fnanchor">[121:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 122 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_122" id="Page_v2_122">[122]</a></span>But both in this and the other departments of his work, we are bound to
estimate Hume, as we do great <!-- Page 123 --><span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_v2_123" id="Page_v2_123">[123]</a></span>workmen in all departments of mental
labour, not by the state of his science at the present day, but by that
in which he found it. To comprehend how far it may be practicable for
any one mind to create a full and satisfactory history of the island of
Great Britain, without having the advantage of the previous labours of
many minds, occupied in elucidating the details of the various branches
of knowledge with which he has to deal, let us cast a casual glance at
the prominent topics which must be fully discussed in such a History, if
it be a satisfactory work.</p>

<p>The historian should be master of every scrap of information contained
in Greek or Roman authors, about the connexion of the people of the
ancient world with our island. In the works of Cæsar and <!-- Page 124 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_124" id="Page_v2_124">[124]</a></span>Tacitus this
will be a simple matter; but scattered about among the productions of
the Panegyrists, and in other such obscure quarters, there are many
important incidental notices, which will not be so easily found or so
satisfactorily interpreted. To this the investigator must add more
recondite stores of knowledge, collected from etymological
investigations among the roots of languages&mdash;Celtic and Teutonic. He
must study Strabo, Ptolemy, and the other geographers; and interpreting
the information collected from them, and the incidents derived from the
other sources above alluded to, with his etymological inquiries, he must
endeavour to solve the vexed questions about the migration of
races&mdash;whether the Cimbri were pure Celts? whether the Welsh are the
descendants of that race? whether the Caledonii, with whom Agricola
fought, were Celts? who and what were those mysterious people, called
the Picts?</p>

<p>There must be some criticism, however unsatisfactory it may be, on the
worship anterior to the introduction of Christianity, and on the
vestiges of that and of other early customs supposed to be supplied by
the remnants of ancient masonry and engineering, with which our island
abounds. The historian must next be able to show what is truly known,
and what is not, regarding the inroads of the Teutonic tribes, and must
be able to fathom the learning of the German antiquaries on this
department of history. Here the early literature of Ireland, of which so
much has lately been printed by O'Conor and others, and the relics of
Scandinavian metrical histories, will widen the inquiry, while they
render it more satisfactory.</p>

<p>Having got these settlers from the Teutonic tribes, the Saxons as they
are generally called, established in the island, the peculiar internal
policy, national <!-- Page 125 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_125" id="Page_v2_125">[125]</a></span>character, and literature of Britain, begin to assume
a shape under the eye of the historian, and to gather round them their
distinctive attributes as he proceeds. He will soon have to deal with
the birth of laws and customs, which, modelled to the progress of an
increasing population and civilisation, are still in daily practice.</p>

<p>From this epoch downwards, he has to watch the changes of the national
literature. Observing it in its purely Anglo-Saxon period, he must
estimate the extent to which it was altered by the adoption of
Norman-French as a court language, while Anglo-Saxon still continued to
be the tongue of the common people; and mark the continued existence of
this fundamental Teutonic speech, and its action upon the language of
the court, until the former became the established literary language of
the day, the latter merely imparting to it one of its characteristic
features. Thus tracing these elements from their respective sources down
to the days of Chaucer, the influence of the revival of classical
learning upon modern language and thought must find a place, and English
literature must be described in its progress towards and arrival at full
manhood. Along with this inquiry, there should be an ancillary
investigation into the causes why the language and literature of the
Scottish lowlands have so long differed from those of England, though
both springing from the same root.</p>

<p>Returning to the Anglo-Saxon period, another and more laborious inquiry
opens in the department of the laws and public institutions. There must
be a search after those which were peculiar to the Anglo-Saxons; and in
dealing with authorities posterior to the conquest, the historian must
carefully sift them, that he may ascertain the extent to which any law
or custom was undoubtedly Anglo-Saxon. After having <!-- Page 126 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_126" id="Page_v2_126">[126]</a></span>ascertained how
much of the spirit of feudal institutions had tinged the purely Saxon
usages, he must next follow the progress of feudalism abroad, and fully
explain the effect produced on Britain by its full grown importation at
the era of the Conquest. In conjunction with this large inquiry, the
jurisprudence of Rome must be kept in view; first, as some relics of it
in municipal institutions, and otherwise, may have been associated with
the very earliest forms of internal organization in modern Europe; and
secondly, after its letter had been buried for centuries, as it was
resuscitated by the civilians and canonists, and brought in array
against the common law of England, and amalgamated with the feudal
system in Scotland. From these elements the history of Parliament and of
municipal bodies, the prerogatives of the crown, and the rights and
privileges of the subject, together with the practical administration of
the law, ought all to be developed in their origin and growth. The state
of knowledge and of opinion among the people at large, on political
matters, and particularly on the manner in which they are governed,
should form a part of this constitutional inquiry.</p>

<p>The history of religion should occupy a conspicuous place in the
historian's studies. In the folios of the Bollandists, no inconsiderable
portion of the scanty records of the civil history of the period are to
be found. A full and patient study of the Roman Catholic creed and
polity in their rise and development, is necessary for the effectual
employment of the knowledge thus acquired; and it is needless to say how
many other creeds and systems must be studied by the historian of
Britain. By observing its mere results on the outward history of a
people, the inquirer will never know the real influence of any system of
religious tenets. A brief survey shows us <!-- Page 127 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_127" id="Page_v2_127">[127]</a></span>the outward demonstrations.
But to be acquainted with the character of the internal impulses of any
religious creed, to see how the fire glows and radiates within the bosom
of the votary, we must study the vital elements of the creed itself with
industry and with zeal.</p>

<p>The language and literature of the country have already been alluded to.
The state of the arts at different times must be carefully watched and
explained. To accomplish this task, the historian should possess a wide
knowledge of the principles and practice of art: not that conventional
knowledge which teaches him how to distinguish from all that are below
them those efforts which are entitled to the approbation of the
fastidious, but the catholic spirit, which enables the mind fully to
estimate progress before perfection is reached.</p>

<p>All the departments of the historian's knowledge are more or less
blended with each other. From the sixth century downwards, for several
ages, the coinage of the realm only marks the state of the arts or
serves to adjust disputed chronologies: gradually, however, the
historian feels it becoming involved with more complex elements
connected with the state of society, and at last the great question of
the currency and the monetary system of the country has to be grappled
with. Here the whole field of political economy is opened up. It is
needless to say, that the historian, especially he who treats of a
people in any degree civilized, must be thoroughly imbued with political
economy.</p>

<p>The state of manufactures and of the sciences should not be neglected. A
history of Britain during the nineteenth century, containing no account
of the triumphs of the steam engine, or of the progress of railway
engineering, would give a very imperfect view <!-- Page 128 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_128" id="Page_v2_128">[128]</a></span>of the living progress of
the nation. The history of the early period would be more satisfactory,
if it informed us when the pump and the potter's wheel were first used
in Britain. Closely akin to this subject is the progress of agriculture,
which, however, is a matter simpler and more easy of attainment than
many of the historian's other objects of inquiry.</p>

<p>In truth, it may be safely said, that every circumstance that can be
discovered concerning the particular country, and every thing, whether
animate or inanimate that is on its surface, comes within the compass of
its history, using that word in the sense of merely civil
history,&mdash;unless in so far as it belongs to what is natural history. And
yet even from this science civil history has many lights to receive.
Human physiology is intimately connected with the elucidations of the
historian; and it would appear that, in regard to the influence of
political institutions on the physical as well as the moral state of
races of men, we are still only on the threshold of knowledge. Here the
physiologist, and the recorder of political events, who heretofore have
travelled on different roads, may some day or other find a common object
of exertion, and may tell us, by their united labours, why the race that
inhabited ancient Egypt, from being the most inventive, should have been
among the most supine of people; why the Chinese should have passed
through an epoch of active discovery, and should have thenceforth,
unlike the rest of the world, neither forgotten nor improved the fruits
of their original enterprise; why the Celts, once the nurses of European
learning, should, at a later time, have appeared as if doomed to retire
before the ardent genius of the Teutonic race; and why this race, after
being long inferior to other branches of the Caucasian family, should
appear, <!-- Page 129 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_129" id="Page_v2_129">[129]</a></span>with British enterprise and German thought, likely to absorb
the faculties of the rest of mankind.</p>

<p>The historian must not wholly neglect other natural productions. The
inferior animals and the vegetable kingdom are intimately connected with
the fate of the human beings who are the immediate object of his
labours. With geology he may appear to have comparatively little
concern; yet the marble of Greece, and the coal and iron of Britain,
have had no little influence on the destinies of these nations.</p>

<p>Hume did so much towards the completion of that circle of knowledge with
which the historian has to deal, that he was the first to add to a mere
narrative of events, an inquiry into the progress of the people, and of
their arts, literature, manners, and general social condition. This
attempt was so original, that, as it embodied in some measure the theory
developed in Voltaire's "<cite class="nonital">Essai sur les Moeurs</cite>," first published in 1756,
when the first volume of the "History of the Stuarts" had been two years
before the public, it was supposed that Hume might have borrowed the
idea from some fragments of that work which had been surreptitiously
printed with the title "<cite class="nonital">Abrégé de l'Histoire Universelle</cite>." There seems
to be no room, however, for such a supposition. Hume's own "Political
Discourses" are as close an approach to this method of inquiry as the
work of Voltaire; and if we look for such productions of other writers
as may have led him into this train of thought, it would be more just to
name Bacon and Montesquieu.<a name="FNanchor_129:1_100" id="FNanchor_129:1_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_129:1_100" class="fnanchor">[129:1]</a> The works of such authors as Guizot
and Hallam may teach us that much had to be added to Hume's system <!-- Page 130 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_130" id="Page_v2_130">[130]</a></span>of
historical composition, to render it perfect; but they do so in the same
manner as the last steam engine shows us how many improvements have been
made on the inventions of Watt.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>We now resume the correspondence with Millar. The letter immediately
following, puts beyond a doubt, what had only been partially believed,
that Hume had, at one time, expressed an intention of writing an
ecclesiastical history. Of the manner in which he would have executed
such a task, opinions will widely vary.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 15th March, 1762.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am very glad that you are in so good a way, and
that you think so soon of making a new edition. I am running
over both the ancient history and the Tudors, and shall send
you them up by the wagon as soon as they are corrected. Please
tell Mr. Strahan, to keep carefully this copy I send up, as
well as that which I left of the Stuarts; for if you intend to
print an octavo edition next summer, it will be better to do
it from these copies which are corrected, than from the new
edition, where there will necessarily be some errors of the
press.</p>

<p>"I give you full authority to contradict the report, that I am
writing or intend to write an ecclesiastical history; I have
no such intention; and I believe never shall. I am beginning
to love peace very much, and resolve to be more cautious than
formerly in creating myself enemies. But in contradicting this
report, <!-- Page 131 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_131" id="Page_v2_131">[131]</a></span>you will be so good as not to impeach Mr. Mallet's
veracity; for 'tis certain I said to Lord Chesterfield (from
whom Mr. Mallet first had it) that I had entertained such a
thought; but my saying so proceeded less from any serious
purpose, than from a view of trying how far such an idea would
be relished by his lordship.</p>

<p>"I have not laid aside thoughts of continuing my History to
the period after the Revolution. It is not amiss to be idle a
little time; but it is probable I shall tire of that kind of
life: and if I then find that the public desires to see more
of me, and that the great will not shut up their papers from
me, I shall set to work in earnest.</p>

<p>"I never thought that Lord Kames' Elements would be a popular
book; but I hoped, that, as you engage for no copy money, it
would certainly defray the charge of paper and print; and on
that footing alone I recommended it to you. I find the
author's expectations raised up to a vast pitch, and indeed
there are some parts of the work ingenious and curious; but it
is too abtruse and crabbed ever to take with the public. As to
the advice you desire me to give him, it is certainly very
salutary; but I fancy neither I nor any other of his friends
will ever venture to mention it. The admonitions, which come
from you, are commonly the most effectual; and if this book do
not sell, I think it were not amiss, that you tell him the
plain truth without disguise or circumlocution. I find the
booksellers here have sold off all their share of my Essays,
and are desirous of another edition, which, however, I told
them, I believed you was not ready for. I desire to be
informed two or three months before you put it to the press:
because <!-- Page 132 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_132" id="Page_v2_132">[132]</a></span>I intend to make some considerable alterations on
some parts of them.</p>

<p>"I hope Mrs. Millar intends to pay us a visit next summer, and
that you will be of the party. Please make my most sincere
respects to her. I am, dear Sir," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_132:1_101" id="FNanchor_132:1_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_132:1_101" class="fnanchor">[132:1]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"8th April, 1762.</p>

<p>"I shall answer your story of Charles Townsend very fully, by
another story of the same gentleman. Three years ago, when I
was in London, I was told by a friend, that Mr. Townsend said,
that my History of the Stuarts (the only one then published,)
was full of gross blunders in the facts: he had consulted all
the authentic documents, particularly the journals of the
House of Commons, and found it so. When I made light of this
information, as knowing somewhat of Mr. Townsend's hasty
manner of speaking, my friend said, that I ought not so much
to neglect the matter; because Mr. Townsend had told him that
Mr. Dyson, clerk to the House of Commons, a man of knowledge
and solidity, had made to him the same observation. I was a
little surprised and alarmed at this; and I went to Mr.
Elliot, whom I desired to speak to Mr. Dyson, and to tell him
that there was nothing in the world I desired so much as to be
informed of my errors, and that he would oblige me extremely
by pointing out those mistakes. Mr. Dyson replied, that he had
never in his life spoke of the matter to Mr. Townsend; and
that though he differed from me in my reasonings and views of
the <!-- Page 133 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_133" id="Page_v2_133">[133]</a></span>constitution, he had observed no blunders in facts,
except one with regard to the dispensing power: which, by the
bye, was the one also remarked to me by the Speaker, and which
I corrected in the second edition. It was not an error with
regard to the reign of James Second, but with regard to that
of King William, which I had not sufficiently examined. I
assure you there is not a quotation that I did not see with
mine own eyes, except two or three at most, which I took from
Tyrrel or Brady, because I had not the books referred to. That
there is no mistake in such a number of references, would be
rash or even absurd to affirm: that the printer also has not
sometimes made mistakes in the name of the author or in the
number of the page quoted, is what I dare not aver: for I only
compared the sheet now and then with my manuscript, and was
contented to be as correct as possible in the text. I knew
that these mistakes could neither be frequent nor material.
But if people, finding a few here and there, point them out,
and give them as a specimen of the whole, I know no remedy for
this malice, but to allow them to go on. Men of candour will
judge otherwise without scrutiny: and men of diligence and
industry will find that the case is otherwise, upon
scrutiny.<a name="FNanchor_133:1_102" id="FNanchor_133:1_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_133:1_102" class="fnanchor">[133:1]</a></p>

<p>"I have heard of Charles Townsend's extolling and decrying me
alternately, according as the humour bites; and all the world
knows this to be his <!-- Page 134 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_134" id="Page_v2_134">[134]</a></span>character. He is perhaps angry with me
at present, because I did not wait of him when I was in
London. It is strange, that great men in England should slight
and neglect men of letters when they pay court to them, and
rail at them when they do not. I have a regard to Mr. Townsend
as a man of parts, I believe of very great parts; but I attach
myself to no great man, and visit none of them but such as
happen to be my friends, and particular acquaintance. I wish
they would consider me as equally independent with themselves,
or more so. However, there is no necessity of enraging Mr.
Townsend farther by the story I told you in the first
paragraph; and therefore I would not have you communicate it
to any body, except a very particular friend whom you can
trust. You may read the second paragraph to every
body."<a name="FNanchor_134:1_103" id="FNanchor_134:1_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:1_103" class="fnanchor">[134:1]</a></p>

<p>In the following letter to Millar, we find him professing his ignorance
of the practical application of the fine arts in engraving. Although he
has written on the philosophy of taste, we find no traces in his
writings of what the Germans have denominated the aesthetic; no sense of
an internal emotion arising from the contemplation of works of art. In
his travels, he had an opportunity of seeing many fine pictures, but he
never mentions one; and it does not appear, from any incident in his
life, or allusion in his letters, which I can remember, that he had ever
really admired a picture or a statue.<a name="FNanchor_134:2_104" id="FNanchor_134:2_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_134:2_104" class="fnanchor">[134:2]</a></p>

<p>"I like much better your publishing in volumes than in
numbers. Though this last method has been often practised, it
has somewhat of a quackish air, which you have always avoided,
as well as myself. I know not what to do for frontispieces; I
have no manner of skill myself in designing, and am not able
to point out the most proper subjects, nor the method of
executing them. On the whole, I think it an expense which may
be spared; but if you continue in the resolution of having
some such ornament, I could write a letter to Allan Ramsay,
who, I hope, would take the pains of directing the engraver.
As to my head, I think that also a superfluous expense; and as
there is no picture of me in London, I know not how it can be
executed: with submission to you, would it not be better to
throw these charges on the paper and print? I do not imagine,
because these ornaments have helped off the sale of Smollett's
History, that mine would be the better for them.<a name="FNanchor_135:1_105" id="FNanchor_135:1_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_135:1_105" class="fnanchor">[135:1]</a> These
arts are seldom practised twice with the same success.</p>

<p>"I do not lose view of my design to continue my History, at
least for two reigns more; but I question whether party
prejudices with regard to me, are as yet sufficiently
subsided, to enable me to carry on that work, without meeting
with repulses and disgusts from those who have the materials
in their power, which must serve for the foundation of my
narrative: a little farther time will, I hope, operate that
effect."<a name="FNanchor_135:2_106" id="FNanchor_135:2_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_135:2_106" class="fnanchor">[135:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 136 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_136" id="Page_v2_136">[136]</a></span>He concludes this letter by saying, "I remove my house this week to
James's Court."</p>

<p>Entering a low gateway which pierces the line of lofty houses along the
Lawnmarket, one finds oneself in a square court, surrounded by houses,
which have now evidently fallen to the lot of humbler inhabitants than
those for whom they were erected. These spaces, walled off by the
intervening houses from the main street, were in the Scottish
metropolis, like the similar edifices of the French nobility, frequently
designed with the view of protecting those who dwelt within the gate
from the unwelcome intrusion of either legal or illegal force. But it is
probable that James's Court scarcely dates back to times so lawless, and
that it was built early in the eighteenth century. The plan of a closed
court was, perhaps, adopted as a means of enabling a small community to
have the civic functions of lighting and cleaning performed more
accurately than they were then administered to the inhabitants at large.</p>

<p>Entering one of the doors opposite the main entrance, the stranger is
sometimes led by a friend, wishing to afford him an agreeable surprise,
down flight after flight of the steps of a stone staircase, and when he
imagines he is descending so far into the bowels of the earth, he
emerges on the edge of a cheerful crowded thoroughfare, connecting
together the Old and New Town; the latter of which lies spread before
him, a contrast to the gloom from which he has emerged. When he looks up
to the building containing the upright street through which he has
descended, he sees that vast pile of tall houses standing at the head of
the Mound, which creates astonishment in every visiter of Edinburgh.
This vast fabric is built on the declivity of a hill, and thus one
entering <!-- Page 137 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_137" id="Page_v2_137">[137]</a></span>on the level of the Lawnmarket, is at the height of several
stories from the ground on the side next the New Town. In Hume's day, a
lake lay not many yards from the base of the building; and the whole
space now occupied by the streets and squares of the New Town, was open
ground, covered with woodland in those places where it did not consist
of agricultural ground or barren heath. A full view of the surrounding
country must have been possessed by every floor in this mass of
buildings. I have ascertained that by ascending the western of the two
stairs facing the entry of James's Court, to the height of three
stories, we arrive at the door of David Hume's house, which, of the two
doors on that landing-place, is the one towards the left.<a name="FNanchor_137:1_107" id="FNanchor_137:1_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:1_107" class="fnanchor">[137:1]</a></p>

<p>Of the first impression made on a stranger, at that period, when
entering such a house, a vivid description is given by Sir Walter Scott
in "Guy Mannering;" and in Counsellor Pleydell's library, with its
collection of books and the prospect from the window, we have probably
an accurate picture of the room in which Hume spent his studious hours
when he was in his own house in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>When Boswell describes the veritable locality of the house in which he
did actually receive the illustrious Dr. Johnson, he tells us at the
same time that it was in James's Court. Hume had then left his house,
and it appears that James Boswell became his tenant.<a name="FNanchor_137:2_108" id="FNanchor_137:2_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_137:2_108" class="fnanchor">[137:2]</a> One cannot
therefore resist the conclusion, <!-- Page 138 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_138" id="Page_v2_138">[138]</a></span>that the house thus consecrated, was
the very one which had been occupied by Hume. Would Boswell communicate
such a fact, or tell what manner of man was the landlord of the
habitation into which he had, under the guise of hospitality, entrapped
the arch-intolerant?<a name="FNanchor_138:1_109" id="FNanchor_138:1_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_138:1_109" class="fnanchor">[138:1]</a> Who shall appreciate the mental conflict
which Boswell may have experienced on this occasion! On the one side he
would have to consider, whether it would not be more candid to let the
<!-- Page 139 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_139" id="Page_v2_139">[139]</a></span>appalling truth be known. But would Johnson have been able to "sleep o'
nights" in such a house? The dilemma might not have been so easily
solved as the dinner with Wilkes.</p>

<p>Hume's house was, during his absence in France, occupied by Dr. Blair;
so that the old flat, three stories up from the entrance in James's
Court, had in its day sheltered inmates of no common eminence.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 22d Nov. 1762.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As yours of the 16th of last month did not require
any immediate reply, I have used the freedom to delay
answering it. I am glad to find your two new editions so well
advanced: I hope they will be successful. Some people tell me,
that, as the two volumes last published do not shock any party
prejudices, they have been better received than the former,
and procure a good reception for the whole. If I should see
them make any farther progress, it would be the best
encouragement for me to proceed in writing the more recent
history. I am far from losing sight of that project; but it is
better not to begin it, till matters are more ripe for the
execution, and till I find, that every one would frankly
concur in opening their cabinets, and allowing me the use of
all papers which may be necessary for my purpose. I had a
letter from Mr. Mallet lately, by which I find, that he will
no longer be an obstacle in my way; for he tells me that his
History of the Duke of Marlborough is ready for the press;
which is more than I or most people expected.</p>

<p>"Lord Marischal wrote me lately, that the celebrated Rousseau
had taken shelter with him at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neufchâtel</span>; but that he had
thoughts of coming to <!-- Page 140 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_140" id="Page_v2_140">[140]</a></span>England, and desired to know of me, if
he could make an edition of his works by which he could gain a
little money for his subsistence, as he was not interested. He
wished also, that I could recommend him to a bookseller. You
have told me, that you do not care to deal in French books;
but if he should publish any new work, might he not have a
translation of it ready to be published at the same time with
the original? And would not you be willing to deal with him in
that shape? I should think him very fortunate, if he were in
your hands. I beg my compliments to Mrs. Millar, who, I hope,
is at Bath, more for her amusement than her health. I am, dear
sir, yours sincerely.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;As your edition on royal paper is not numerous, I shall
only desire three copies of it to be sent me, and shall
reserve the other three for the octavo edition. Be so good
therefore as to embark three copies in any parcel you send to
Edinburgh. The peace will now make the intercourse of trade
more open between us. The mention of peace reminds me to thank
you for your assistance in making out my subscription last
year, which is likely to turn out so much to my advantage. The
stocks are now very high; but I suppose will not come to their
full height this twelvemonth, and till then I fancy you will
not think it prudent in me to sell out."<a name="FNanchor_140:1_110" id="FNanchor_140:1_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_140:1_110" class="fnanchor">[140:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>That Mallet had his History of the Duke of Marlborough ready for press,
was, as Hume gently says, more than he or most people expected. However,
Mallet seems to have convinced him that it really was the case; and his
success in carrying conviction to the prince of sceptics, is a brilliant
instance of that <!-- Page 141 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_141" id="Page_v2_141">[141]</a></span>mingled cunning and impudence by which he had made
himself a great man. The literary history of the life of Marlborough is
well known. The duchess had left £1000 to Glover and Mallet, as a fee
for a life to be written by them jointly. Glover gave up his share of
the labour and its reward, and Mallet obtained the £1000. The service he
gave in return, consisted entirely in the labour of convincing the
world, by hints and skilfully mysterious announcements, that he had made
considerable progress in the work, though he died without having
commenced it; and if this systematic deception had been the service for
which he was paid, it would have been admitted that he had done his
duty.<a name="FNanchor_141:1_111" id="FNanchor_141:1_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_141:1_111" class="fnanchor">[141:1]</a> The following letter is a memorable instance of the manner
in which Mallet conducted his operations; and it shows at the same time
his infinitely lofty notion of his own position. He had managed to be a
great author among the aristocracy, and to be a great aristocrat among
authors; and the air of calm <!-- Page 142 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_142" id="Page_v2_142">[142]</a></span>superiority which he adopts towards Hume
is not the least remarkable feature in the production.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have done at last, what nothing but the greatest
regard for the writer, and the truest friendship for the man,
could have made me submit to; I have gone over both your
volumes again, with the eye and attention of a mere
grammarian. The task of looking after verbal mistakes, or
errors against the idiom of a tongue, though not unnecessary,
is trivial, and disgusting in the greatest decree; but your
work, and you, deserved it of me: and I could not have
forgiven myself had I not treated yours as I hope and expect
you will do mine.</p>

<p>I have not been idle; though I give no account of my progress
to one in a hundred I converse with; as it contains several
particulars of the reigns of the two brothers, Charles and
James, the most interesting though the least known parts of
King William's, and embraces the whole of Queen Anne's reign,
together with some anecdotes relative to her successor,&mdash;it
will swell into two quarto volumes. I am resolved, too, that
the translation, which will be done here by an excellent hand
under my own eye, shall appear at the same time the original
does. These are some of the causes that occasion the
complaints I have been teased with: and there are many others,
that would make no figure on paper, though they are
unavoidable and consume much irretrievable time. But what is
well done is done soon; and, as I have not you in my way, I
should not feel the least uneasiness, if all our other
complete historians should write the same period twenty times
over. My work, both in matter and form, would still be new. If
you are upon the undertaking, which you desired might remain a
secret, I dare assure you, that besides the merit of accuracy
and impartiality, it will have all the charm of novelty; for
such a work, on a rational and philosophical <!-- Page 143 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_143" id="Page_v2_143">[143]</a></span>plan, is a
thing, as Milton has it, unattempted yet in prose or rhime.

</div>
</div>

<p>The following letter is a not less curious revelation of Mallet's
proceedings.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 21st April, 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I had a letter from Mr. Mallett, in which he tells
me, that he has run over carefully the two volumes of my
History last published, and has wrote all his remarks, as well
on the language as matter, on the margin. He said, that he
would find an opportunity to send them to me. I replied to
him, that I was extremely obliged to him, (as I certainly am,)
and that if he sent them to you, you would soon find an
opportunity of conveying them to me. I wish you would speak to
him on that subject, as you have occasion to meet with him,
and would send the books carefully to me by the first parcel
you send to Edinburgh. I should desire you also to give him a
new copy in place of this which he has sacrificed; but if
there be only a word here and there, I can efface them, after
transcribing them into my own copy, and can afterwards restore
the book as good as ever.</p>

<p>"In the same letter, he complains much of a report, that I was
writing the English History since the revolution: which he
says he cannot believe, because it would be a very invidious
task to him. I answered him, that by his former letter I
imagined his History was just ready for the press; that I had
not wrote a line of the History of that period; but if I
undertake it, one great inducement would be the hopes of
<!-- Page 144 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_144" id="Page_v2_144">[144]</a></span>seeing his volumes published before me; by which means, I
could hope for much light and great materials; that as he was
near twenty years advanced before me, it was ridiculous to
fear that I could overtake him; and that I was glad of the
report he mentioned, if it would prove a spur to his industry.
I find Mr. Mallet would fain be like the dog in the manger,
neither eat himself nor allow others to eat. I should have a
breach with him, and might expect all ill offices from him, if
I pursue my plan; but this would be a frivolous consideration,
where his anger would be so ill-founded. As soon as the octavo
edition of my History is finished, please send me a copy of
it. I should be pleased to run it over; and make an errata to
it. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_144:1_114" id="FNanchor_144:1_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_144:1_114" class="fnanchor">[144:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The following letter to Elliot shows the zeal with which Hume carried on
that systematic removal from his works of all passages tending to favour
popular rights, which has been already alluded to.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 12th March, 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;In this new edition I have corrected several
mistakes and oversights, which had chiefly proceeded from the
plaguy prejudices of Whiggism, with which I was too much
infected when I began this work. I corrected some of these
mistakes in a former edition; but being resolved to add to
this edition the quotations of authorities for the reigns of
James I. and Charles I., I was obliged to run over again the
most considerable authors who had treated of these reigns; and
I happily discovered <!-- Page 145 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_145" id="Page_v2_145">[145]</a></span>some more mistakes, which I have now
corrected. As I began the History with these two reigns, I now
find that they, above all the rest, have been corrupted with
Whig rancour, and that I really deserved the name of a party
writer, and boasted without any foundation of my impartiality:
but if you now do me the honour to give this part of my work a
second perusal, I am persuaded that you will no longer throw
on me this reproachful epithet, and will acquit me of all
propensity to Whiggism. If you still continue to upbraid me, I
shall be obliged to retaliate on you, and cry, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Whig vous
même</i>.</p>

<p>"In page 33, vol. v. you will find a full justification of the
impositions laid on by James I. without authority of
parliament: in p. 113, 114, 389, a justification of
persecuting the Puritans: in p. 180, a justification of
Charles I. for levying tonnage and poundage without consent of
parliament: in p. 100, I acquit James I. of prevarication,
with which I had before rashly charged him. This last mistake
indeed was innocent, and I can easily account for it. I had
read Buckingham's narrative in Rushworth and Franklyn, the two
opposite collectors: I saw what I thought the same paper in
the Parliamentary History; but I did not attend to a line at
the bottom, in which it is said, that the paper is taken from
the records more full, than in the preceding collection: when
I read it lately, I found the article here quoted, so that
this blunder proceeded not from any spirit of Whiggery.</p>

<p>"I now justify James II. more explicitly in his exercise of
the dispensing power, which was intimately interwoven with the
constitution and monarchy&mdash;see vol. vi. p. 393-394, 395-400.
In vol. iv. p. 322-323, I mention a very remarkable vein of
tyranny, or <!-- Page 146 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_146" id="Page_v2_146">[146]</a></span>exertion of arbitrary power, practised in that
period,<a name="FNanchor_146:1_115" id="FNanchor_146:1_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_146:1_115" class="fnanchor">[146:1]</a> and which came to my knowledge since the first
publication of that volume.</p>

<p>"There are many other improvements and alterations throughout
the whole; and I am glad that Millar has of himself made you
an offer of this edition. Without flattering you I must say,
that there is nobody whom I more desire to see my writings as
correct as I can make them; and I was thinking to desire Mr.
Millar to make you this offer.</p>

<p>"But there is no end of correcting. In this new edition, vol.
v. p. 205, I have inserted a pretty curious story of Sir
George Markham, which I took from Lord Lansdowne, whom I
esteemed safe authority for a Whig story: but I have since
been shown Hobart's Reports, which is infinitely more
authentic than Lord Lansdowne; and the story is there told so
entirely, as to justify the King and the Star-chamber, so that
you may still reproach me that the villanous leaven is not
entirely purged off.<a name="FNanchor_146:2_116" id="FNanchor_146:2_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_146:2_116" class="fnanchor">[146:2]</a></p>

<p>"I am engaged in no work at present; but if I tire of
idleness, or more properly speaking, of reading for amusement,
I may probably continue my History. My only discouragement is,
that I cannot hope to finish this work in my closet, but must
apply to the great for papers and intelligence, a thing I
mortally abhor.</p>

<p>"Is it not hard and tyrannical in you, more hard <!-- Page 147 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_147" id="Page_v2_147">[147]</a></span>and
tyrannical than any act of the Stuarts, not to allow me to
publish my Dialogues? Pray, do you not think that a proper
dedication may atone for what is exceptionable in them? I am
become much of my friend Corbyn Morrice's mind, who says, that
he writes all his books for the sake of the dedications.</p>

<p>"I am very glad to hear from Lord Minto, that you intend to
pass a great part of the ensuing summer in this country.
Though you be now become a great man, I doubt not but I should
receive very much satisfaction from your society and
conversation; that is, if I be not jostled out by suitors who
press in upon me.</p>

<p>"Meanwhile, I am, dear sir, your affectionate friend and
servant."<a name="FNanchor_147:1_117" id="FNanchor_147:1_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:1_117" class="fnanchor">[147:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He writes to Millar, on 10th March, 1763, "I am in a good measure idle
at present: but if I tire of this way of life, I shall certainly
continue my History, and have no thoughts of any other work. But in this
state of affairs, I suppose your people of rank and quality would throw
the door in my face, because I am a Scotsman."<a name="FNanchor_147:2_118" id="FNanchor_147:2_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_147:2_118" class="fnanchor">[147:2]</a></p>

<p>And again at a later date:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 28th March, 1763.</p>

<p>"I never lose view of the project of continuing my History. I
may perhaps very soon gather silently together the books which
will enable me to sketch out the reigns of King William and
Queen Anne, and shall finish them afterwards, together with
that of George I., in London. But to tell you the truth, I
<!-- Page 148 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_148" id="Page_v2_148">[148]</a></span>have an aversion to appear in that capital till I see that
more justice is done to me with regard to the preceding
volumes. The languishing sale of this edition makes me
conjecture that the time is not yet come; and the general rage
against the Scots is an additional discouragement. I think the
Scotch minister is obliged to make me some compensation for
this.</p>

<p>"I am told that Mr. Ralph is dead, who had certainly made a
large collection of books and pamphlets for his work. I should
be glad to know into whose hands they are fallen, and would
purchase them if they could be got at a reasonable price.</p>

<p>"I hear Dr. Armstrong has sent you over a most violent
renunciation of Wilkes's friendship.<a name="FNanchor_148:1_119" id="FNanchor_148:1_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:1_119" class="fnanchor">[148:1]</a> Wilkes is indeed
very blamable in indulging himself so much in national
reflections; which are low, vulgar, and ungenerous, and come
with a bad grace from him, who conversed so much with our
countrymen. My compliments to Mrs. Millar, who, I hope, will
favour me with a visit this summer. I am, dear sir, yours
sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_148:2_120" id="FNanchor_148:2_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_148:2_120" class="fnanchor">[148:2]</a></p>

<p>On the same day he writes to Adam Smith:</p>

<p>"I set up a chaise in May next, which will give me the liberty of
travelling about; and you may be sure a journey to Glasgow will be one
of the first I <!-- Page 149 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_149" id="Page_v2_149">[149]</a></span>shall undertake. I intend to require, with great
strictness, an account how you have been employing your leisure, and I
desire you to be ready for that purpose. Wo be to you if the balance be
against you! Your friends here will also expect that I should bring you
with me."<a name="FNanchor_149:1_121" id="FNanchor_149:1_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_149:1_121" class="fnanchor">[149:1]</a></p>

<p>A few letters written at this time to his friends, on the subject of the
arrears of half-pay due for his services as judge-advocate,<a name="FNanchor_149:2_122" id="FNanchor_149:2_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_149:2_122" class="fnanchor">[149:2]</a>
afford the following passages of general interest. To Oswald he says, on
3d April&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall add, that it is the only thing in my life I ever asked, it is
the only thing I ever shall ask, and consequently, it is the only thing
I ever shall obtain. Those who assist me in procuring it do me a great
favour, and I very willingly stand obliged to my friends for their good
offices: but of the government and ministry, I ask it as my due. I
imagined that after Lord Bute's consent was obtained, all difficulties
had been surmounted."<a name="FNanchor_149:3_123" id="FNanchor_149:3_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_149:3_123" class="fnanchor">[149:3]</a></p>

<p>To another correspondent he says,&mdash;</p>

<p>"To tell you the truth, dear Crawford, I made it a rule from the
beginning of my life never to seek a favour of any man; and this humour,
which, if you be very indulgent to me, you will call modesty, if less
so, pride, I was unwilling to relinquish, after having maintained it
through my youth, and during more difficult circumstances than those in
which I am at present placed."<a name="FNanchor_149:4_124" id="FNanchor_149:4_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_149:4_124" class="fnanchor">[149:4]</a></p>

<p>Hume, like every Scotsman of his day, who concerned himself with any
thing beyond his own domestic circle, took a deep interest in the
progress of the Douglas cause. It is difficult, at the present <!-- Page 150 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_150" id="Page_v2_150">[150]</a></span>day, to
conceive the excitement which this litigation between private parties
occasioned in the public mind. Men about to meet each other in company,
used to lay an injunction on themselves not to open their lips on the
subject, so fruitful was it in debates and brawls; and yet too often
found that their prudence was no match for their enthusiasm. Hume
adopted the view that the alleged children of Lady Jane Douglas were
spurious. The Court of Session decided in favour of this opinion by a
majority of one; but their decision was afterwards reversed by the House
of Lords. The reversal occasioned many severe animadversions on Lord
Mansfield, both by Hume and his friends.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;To-day is the grand question decided by our
judges, whether they will admit of any farther proof with
regard to the Douglas affair, or whether they will rest
contented with the proofs already produced. Their partiality
is palpable and astonishing; yet few people think that they
will dare to refuse inquiring into facts so remarkable and so
strongly attested. They are at present sitting, but I hope to
tell you the issue in a postscript. Our friend
Johnstone<a name="FNanchor_150:1_125" id="FNanchor_150:1_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:1_125" class="fnanchor">[150:1]</a> has wrote the most super-excellentest paper
in the world, which he has promised to send to you this
evening in franks. Please to deliver the enclosed to Colonel
Barré. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_150:2_126" id="FNanchor_150:2_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_150:2_126" class="fnanchor">[150:2]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We have already found one distinguished fellow-countryman of Hume
controversially attacking his <!-- Page 151 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_151" id="Page_v2_151">[151]</a></span>works. But another and greater critic was
soon to appear. Dr. Thomas Reid was preparing for the press his "Inquiry
into the Human Mind," which he published in 1764. His was the greatest
mind which set itself in opposition to Hume's system, in British
literature; and he was great, because he examined the works of the
sceptical philosopher, not in the temper of a wrangler or partisan, but
in the honest spirit of an investigator, who is bound either to believe
in the arguments he is examining, or to set against them a system which
will satisfy his own mind, and the minds of other honest thinkers. Reid
was born in 1710, and he was exactly a year older than Hume, for the
birth-day of both was on the 26th of April.<a name="FNanchor_151:1_127" id="FNanchor_151:1_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_151:1_127" class="fnanchor">[151:1]</a> The philosopher of
common sense, thus brought the accumulated thought and learning of
advanced years to bear on a series of works which the sceptic had
commenced in early youth. There is something in Reid's method of laying
down his principles, and explaining their application, that disinclines
the reader to allow him the palm of original genius, and suggests the
idea that he is a personification of the natural sagacity and useful
industry of his countrymen. But this feeling arises more from his hatred
of such apparent paradoxes as Hume loved, from his courting rather than
avoiding what is familiar and intelligible, and from the titles he gave
to his books, than from deficiency of true originality. Whether his
merit lay in his genius or his industry, he raised a new fabric of
philosophy out of part of those fragments to which the sceptic had
reduced previous systems. The term "common sense," which he used to
characterize his system, had been long employed in <!-- Page 152 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_152" id="Page_v2_152">[152]</a></span>philosophy; and if
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon sens</i> may be held its equivalent, it is to be found in the
preliminary dissertation of a French translation of Hume's miscellaneous
essays, published in the same year as Reid's Inquiry.<a name="FNanchor_152:1_128" id="FNanchor_152:1_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_152:1_128" class="fnanchor">[152:1]</a> Here, and
occasionally by Reid, it is used in its popular sense, expressing
philosophical opinions derived from the general notions of mankind. In
this sense it is an application of induction to mental operations. It
views the opinions of men at large as so many experimental facts, which,
as in the case of the physical operations of nature, may be subjected to
the rules of induction. Hume himself held that mental phenomena are as
regular, and as capable of having laws of nature applied to them, as
physical phenomena. But even if he were right, there is a disturbing
influence at force in the circumstance, that, as the operation of
induction is itself a phenomenon of the same class with those professed
to be subjected to its observation, the philosopher is apt to embody in
his writings the intuitions, if they may be so termed, of his own mind,
instead of giving such an accurate transcript of the results of external
observation as the physical inquirer is generally enabled to present.</p>

<p>Indeed, it is in promulgating the convictions of his own mind as a
metaphysical thinker, more than in his avowed project of inducting from
the common phenomena of the every-day world, that Reid's writings are
most valuable. In the one case he has told us how far Hume's philosophy
is at variance with the general opinions of mankind; in which he is met
by the comprehensive argument, that Hume may, nevertheless, be right,
and the rest of mankind wrong. But in travelling beyond his avowed
object he certainly <!-- Page 153 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_153" id="Page_v2_153">[153]</a></span>has anticipated many of those metaphysical
arguments, on which the basis of the sceptical philosophy has been
attacked; and the world has, perhaps, yet to learn how far the great
system of the German philosophers is under obligations to this powerful
thinker.<a name="FNanchor_153:1_129" id="FNanchor_153:1_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_153:1_129" class="fnanchor">[153:1]</a></p>

<p>Before he put his "Inquiry into the Human Mind," to press, Reid desired,
through Blair's interposition, to subject the manuscript to Hume's
inspection. Fearing that this work might too closely follow the
Warburton school, Hume met the application with the rather petulant
remark: "I wish that the parsons would confine themselves to their old
occupation of worrying one another, and leave philosophers to argue with
temper, moderation, and good manners." But, after inspecting the
manuscript, he thus addressed its author:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>By Dr. Blair's means, I have been favoured with the perusal of
your performance, which I have read with great pleasure and
attention. It is certainly very rare that a piece so deeply
philosophical is wrote with so much spirit, and affords so
much entertainment to the reader; though I must still regret
the disadvantages under which I read it, as I never had the
whole performance at once before me, and could not be able
fully to compare one part with another. To this reason,
chiefly, I ascribed some obscurities, which, in spite of your
short analysis, or abstract, still seem to hang over your
system; for I must do you the justice to own that, when I
enter into your ideas, no man appears to express himself with
<!-- Page 154 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_154" id="Page_v2_154">[154]</a></span>greater perspicuity than you do; a talent which, above all
others, is requisite in that species of literature which you
have cultivated. There are some objections, which I would
willingly propose, to the chapter "Of sight," did I not
suspect that they proceed from my not sufficiently
understanding it; and I am the more confirmed in this
suspicion, as Dr. Blair tells me that the former objections I
made, had been derived chiefly from that cause. I shall
therefore forbear till the whole can be before me, and shall
not at present propose any further difficulties to your
reasonings. I shall only say that, if you have been able to
clear up these abstruse and important subjects, instead of
being mortified, I shall be so vain as to pretend to a share
of the praise; and shall think that my errors, by having at
least some coherence, had led you to make a more strict review
of my principles, which were the common ones, and to perceive
their futility.</p>

<p>As I was desirous to be of some use to you, I kept a watchful
eye all along over your style; but it is really so correct,
and so good English, that I found not any thing worth the
remarking. There is only one passage in this chapter, where
you make use of the phrase, <em>hinder to do</em>, instead of <em>hinder
from doing</em>, which is the English one; but I could not find
the passage when I sought for it. You may judge how
unexceptionable the whole appeared to me, when I could remark
so small a blemish. I beg my compliments to my friendly
adversaries, Dr. Campbell, and Dr. Gerard, and also to Dr.
Gregory, whom I suspect to be of the same disposition, though
he has not openly declared himself such.<a name="FNanchor_154:1_130" id="FNanchor_154:1_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_154:1_130" class="fnanchor">[154:1]</a></p>

<p>This letter called forth the following answer, valuable as an
acknowledgment of the services which the Scottish school of philosophy
owed to Hume.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Dr. Reid</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">King's College, 18th March, 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;On Monday last, Mr. John Farquhar brought me your letter
of February 25th, enclosed in one from Dr. Blair. I thought
myself very happy in having the means of obtaining at
second-hand, through the friendship of Dr. Blair, your opinion
of my performance: and you have been <!-- Page 155 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%"><a name="Page_v2_155" id="Page_v2_155">[155]</a></span>pleased to communicate
it directly in so polite and friendly a manner, as merits
great acknowledgments on my part. Your keeping a watchful eye
over my style, with a view to be of use to me, is an instance
of candour and generosity to an antagonist, which would affect
me very sensibly, although I had no personal concern in it,
and I shall always be proud to follow so amiable an example.
Your judgment of the style, indeed, gives me great
consolation, as I was very diffident of myself in regard to
English, and have been indebted to Drs. Campbell and Gerard
for many corrections of that kind.</p>

<p>In attempting to throw some new light upon these abstruse
subjects, I wish to preserve the due mean betwixt confidence
and despair. But whether I have any success in this attempt or
not, I shall always avow myself your disciple in metaphysics.
I have learned more from your writings in this kind, than from
all others put together. Your system appears to me not only
coherent in all its parts, but likewise justly deduced from
principles commonly received among philosophers; principles
which I never thought of calling in question, until the
conclusions you draw from them in the "Treatise of Human
Nature" made me suspect them. If these principles are solid,
your system must stand; and whether they are or not, can
better be judged after you have brought to light the whole
system that grows out of them, than when the greater part of
it was wrapped up in clouds and darkness. I agree with you,
therefore, that if this system shall ever be demolished, you
have a just claim to a great share of the praise, both because
you have made it a distinct and determinate mark to be aimed
at, and have furnished proper artillery for the purpose.</p>

<p>When you have seen the whole of my performance, I shall take
it as a very great favour to have your opinion upon it, from
which I make no doubt of receiving light, whether I receive
conviction or no. Your friendly adversaries, Drs. Campbell and
Gerard, as well as Dr. Gregory, return their compliments to
you respectfully. A little philosophical society here, of
which all the three are members, is much indebted to you for
its entertainment. Your company would, although we are all
good Christians, be more acceptable <!-- Page 156 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_156" id="Page_v2_156">[156]</a></span>than that of St.
Athanasius; and since we cannot have you upon the bench, you
are brought oftener than any other man to the bar, accused and
defended with great zeal, but without bitterness. If you write
no more in morals, politics, or metaphysics, I am afraid we
shall be at a loss for subjects. I am, respectfully, sir, your
most obliged humble servant.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_121:1_99" id="Footnote_121:1_99"></a><a href="#FNanchor_121:1_99"><span class="label">[121:1]</span></a> The works prepared by the Record Commission, whether it
be true or not that it has failed to fulfil the services expected from
so large an expenditure of the public money, present the sources of
British history on a very different scale from that in which they
appeared before Hume; and if he had lived in the present day, he would
not have attempted to write the history of the first fourteen centuries
in less than three years; or, attempting it, would have palpably
overlooked materials which, in his own time, he could not have found
access to. Among such sources may be viewed, Domesday Book, the <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Rotuli
Hundredorum</span>, the many records of the various courts of justice, the
"Parliamentary writs, or writs of military summons, together with the
records and muniments relating to the suit and service due and performed
to the king's high court of parliament and the councils of the realm, as
affording evidence of attendance given at parliaments and councils;" the
remains of Anglo-Saxon legislation, collected under the name of "Ancient
laws and institutions of England," and the "Ancient laws and institutes
of Wales."</p>

<p>To these must be added the many antiquarian labours of private
individuals or societies, such as the county histories, the works
circulated by the numerous book clubs, and the inquiries into the early
ecclesiastical history, which the controversies on church polity, for
which this age is becoming peculiar, have excited. The publication of
charters and other documents connected with private rights has opened a
means of becoming acquainted with contemporary habits and institutions,
slow certainly but sure. Besides his labours in the Record Commission,
Sir Francis Palgrave has excavated much curious but not attractive
matter, of which the world will never know the value till some Hume
shall arise to give it shape and symmetry.</p>

<p>It has been a usual practice to rank those who, by such critical
inquiries, ascertain the truth regarding minute historical propositions,
in the category of "harmless drudges." But perhaps the character has
been applied to the really useful workers in this field, as inaptly as
it was appropriated by Dr. Johnson to the race of Lexicographers, in a
moment of bitter cynicism. Antiquarianism, archæology, palæology, or
whatever name it may receive, is a field in which there are many paltry
workers; and these are sometimes, from adventitious circumstances,
conspicuous enough to give a tone in popular estimation to the science.
Dates are but one, and perhaps an inferior branch, of the subject; yet
the labours of Petau, of Antine Durand and Clemencet the authors of the
"<cite class="nonital">Art de vérifier les dates</cite>," of Newton, Hailes, and Nicolas, would be
enough to vindicate the dignity of this species of inquiry. It is,
indeed, an essential one to history; and where it has been vaguely or
unscientifically applied, the foundations of historical speculation are
rotten. The prevalent failing of antiquaries is the inability to
distinguish the important from the trifling; to perceive that the labour
which might be necessary to fix the era of the restoration of the study
of the civil law in Europe, would be ill bestowed on an inquiry into the
foundation of some inconsiderable rectorship, or the birth of some
undistinguished landed proprietor. But there is perhaps as much
worthless historical Speculation as trifling Antiquarianism extant in
literature. But it does not follow in either case, from the defects of
the injudicious, that the able and accomplished followers of the subject
were ill employed. A late and signal instance may be adduced of the
intimate connexion of the speculative and the minute departments of
history. Dr. Allen, in his "Inquiry into the rise and progress of the
royal prerogative," maintaining that the older kings of England did not
perform public acts until they had taken the coronation oath of fidelity
to the people, found that there was just one exception, in the case of
Richard II. which disconcerted his theory. It was subsequently shown by
Sir Harris Nicolas, in his "Chronology of History," that in "Rymer's
Fœdera," and other public documents, the regnal years of that reign
had been by mistake antedated a year.</p>

<p>But while it does not follow that the one occupation is less dignified
than the other, it is pretty clear that they cannot, to any great
extent, be both followed by the same person. The limits of human
capacity, and the shortness of human life, seem to forbid such an union;
for literature has produced no one who unites the qualities of a Camden,
a Mabillon, and a Montfouçon, with those of a Hume and a Montesquieu,
though Gibbon and Niebuhr have perhaps come nearest to the union. Mr.
D'Israeli says, (Curiosities of Literature, ii. 182,) "The time has
perhaps arrived, when antiquaries may begin to be philosophers, and
philosophers antiquaries. The unhappy separation of erudition from
philosophy, and of philosophy from erudition, has hitherto thrown
impediments in the progress of the human mind, and the history of man."
But unless that author has himself achieved the united title, by showing
that James I. was a man of great mind, and by characterizing political
economy as a mere "confusion of words," the combination appears not to
have yet been accomplished; and indeed the simple physical impossibility
of the same person who brings the fabric to perfection, having time to
produce the raw materials, seems to render it necessary that in all such
histories as that which Hume undertook, the antiquary shall precede the
historian.</p>

authorities and collating them, is, even by Hume's account of it, one
which a scrupulous investigator would call slovenly. The admission of
any authorities at second hand is, to the extent to which it may be
carried, a breach of the historian's duty. To make sure that he had
rightly estimated their meaning on a first perusal, he should have
collated all his references in proof.</p>

itself, among the MSS. R.S.E. It is simply a document of instructions
for defending an action against Hume, by a builder for repairs. It is in
his own hand, and begins,&mdash;</p>

<p>"At Whitsunday last, Mr. Boswell, advocate, left Mr. Hume's house in
James's Court; and Lady Wallace, dowager, came to it. Mrs. Boswell at
that time sent for Adam Gillies, mason, to repair some plaister which
was broken. Having by this means got access to the house, he went about
and teased Lady Wallace, by telling her that many other things needed
repairs. She frequently bid him let her alone, for she saw no occasion
to trouble the landlord for any thing. Notwithstanding this, he came to
Mr. Hume, and told him that the stone pavement in the kitchen, under the
coal bunker, was all shattered, and must be repaired; and that he was
sent by Lady Wallace to tell him so. Mr. Hume having entire trust in
Lady Wallace's discretion, gave him orders to repair that pavement of
the bunker. Gillies brought him in an account for many other repairs on
the pavement of the kitchen. Mr. Hume told him that he had exceeded his
orders; and that he would not pay him till he should see Lady Wallace,
who was at that time in the country. When she came to town, she told Mr.
Hume the fact, and that Gillies had come to him, not only without her
orders but contrary to them. At the same time, Mrs. Boswell, who had
lived two years in the house, told him, that when she left it, she saw
nothing in the kitchen pavement which needed repairs. Mr. Hume therefore
refused to pay Gillies for any thing, except for the plaister, and also
for whitening the kitchen, for which he had orders. This is the cause
before the court."</p>

Johnson said, "Just enough to light him to hell." Boswell mentions his
having uttered a remark about Hume, too gross to be committed to paper.

manager immediately asked if Mallet had given up writing for the stage:

his pocket.</p>

<p>With Mrs. Mallet, who was in all respects worthy of her husband, Hume
had some acquaintance; but he does not appear to have had much respect
for her. Lord Charlemont says, "I never saw him so much displeased, or
so much disconcerted, as by the petulance of Mrs. Mallet, the conceited
wife of Bolingbroke's editor. This lady, who was not acquainted with
Hume, meeting him one night at an assembly, boldly accosted him in these
words, 'Mr. Hume, give me leave to introduce myself to you; we Deists
ought to know each other.' 'Madam,' replied he, 'I am no Deist; I do not

<p class="section">On the conclusion of the treaty of 1763, the Marquis of Hertford was
appointed ambassador to the court of France. He invited Hume to attend
him as secretary; and there is no reason to believe that the selection
was owing to any other motive than the desire to place an able and
honest man in office. The Marquis was a man of high moral character, and
his religious opinions appear to have been considered by some of his
contemporaries as too zealous and exclusive. The intercourse thus
occasioned, was the commencement of a lasting friendship, in which the
English Marquis and the Scottish philosopher, however separated by
nominal difference of rank, had too genuine a respect for each other to
be affected by such inequalities. The intimacy extended to General
Seymour Conway, the brother of the Marquis; and Hume's <!-- Page 157 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_157" id="Page_v2_157">[157]</a></span>intercourse with
them both, tends to confirm the impression which the portraits of the
two brothers convey to the present generation, of dispositions open,
kind, and artless. In reference to this event, Hume says, in his "own
life," "I retired to my native country of Scotland, determined never
more to set my foot out of it; and retaining the satisfaction of never
having preferred a request to one great man, or even making advances of
friendship to any of them. As I was now turned of fifty, I thought of
passing all the rest of my life in this philosophical manner, when I
received, in 1763, an invitation from the Earl of Hertford, with whom I
was not in the least acquainted, to attend him on his embassy to Paris,
with a near prospect of being appointed secretary to the embassy, and,
in the meanwhile, of performing the functions of that office. This
offer, however inviting, I at first declined, both because I was
reluctant to begin connexions with the great, and because I was afraid
that the civilities and gay company of Paris, would prove disagreeable
to a person of my age and humour: but on his lordship's repeating the
invitation, I accepted of it. I have every reason, both of pleasure and
interest, to think myself happy in my connexions with that nobleman, as
well as afterwards with his brother, General Conway."</p>

<p>We have, in his familiar correspondence, a fuller account of his
feelings on the occasion.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 9th August, 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I have got an invitation, accompanied with
great prospects and expectations, from Lord Hertford, if I
would accompany him, though at first without any character, in
his embassy to Paris. I hesitated much on the acceptance of
this offer, though <!-- Page 158 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_158" id="Page_v2_158">[158]</a></span>in appearance very inviting: and I thought
it ridiculous at my years, to be entering on a new scene, and
to put myself in the lists as a candidate of fortune. But I
reflected that I had in a manner abjured all literary
occupations; that I resolved to give up my future life
entirely to amusements; that there could not be a better
pastime than such a journey, especially with a man of Lord
Hertford's character; and that it would be easy to prevent my
acceptance from having the least appearance of dependance. For
these reasons, and by the advice of every friend whom I
consulted, I at last agreed to accompany his lordship, and I
set out to-morrow for London. I am a little hurried in my
preparations; but I could not depart without bidding you
adieu, my good friend, and without acquainting you with the
reasons of so sudden a movement. I have not great expectations
of revisiting this country soon; but I hope it will not be
impossible but we may meet abroad, which will be a great
satisfaction to me. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_158:1_132" id="FNanchor_158:1_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_158:1_132" class="fnanchor">[158:1]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Baron Mure</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Lisle St. 1st Sept. 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;As I am not sure where you are, nor whether
this direction be right, I am obliged to speak to you with
reserve, both of public affairs and of my own. Of the latter,
I shall only say, that notwithstanding of my first reluctance,
I am entirely reconciled to my present situation, and have a
great prepossession, or rather, indeed, a great esteem and
affection for the person and family whom I am to accompany to
France. The prospect of my being secretary to the embassy is
neither very distant nor is it immediate; but Lord Hertford
will certainly, before our departure, obtain a settlement for
me for <!-- Page 159 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_159" id="Page_v2_159">[159]</a></span>life; which at any events will improve my fortune, and
is a great pledge of his friendship and regard.</p>

<p>"I have insulted [consulted] Elliot, Sir Harry, Oswald, and
all our friends of that administration. The former said to me,
that my situation was, taking all its circumstances, the most
wonderful event in the world. I was now a person clean and
white as the driven snow; and that were I to be proposed for
the see of Lambeth, no objection could henceforth be made to
me. What makes the matter more extraordinary, is, that the
idea first came into my patron's head, without the suggestion
of any one mortal.<a name="FNanchor_159:1_133" id="FNanchor_159:1_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:1_133" class="fnanchor">[159:1]</a></p>

<p>"You must have heard of the late most astonishing events with
regard to public affairs.<a name="FNanchor_159:2_134" id="FNanchor_159:2_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_159:2_134" class="fnanchor">[159:2]</a> Yesterday Lord Bute had a
pretty large company dining with him, to whom he gave an
account of the whole transactions, and desired them to publish
it.</p>

<p>"One of them, a friend of mine, as soon as he went home, took
it down in writing, of which he gave me a copy, and which I
transmit to you. He is a military man, and his style is not
elegant; but I am sure, from another certain authority, that
the <!-- Page 160 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_160" id="Page_v2_160">[160]</a></span>account is in the main just; only I have reason to think
that Lord Halifax was proscribed along with the rest; at least
he said so yesterday to a friend of mine. I wish this high
spirit of his M. may be supported. But <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">femme qui écoute et
ville qui parle sont bientôt rendues</i>. Lord Bute goes abroad
very soon. Some pretend that the present administration is
more enraged against him than is the opposition, on account of
his taking this important step without consulting them. Never
in any history was there so curious a scene; nor was there
ever so formidable a demagogue as this man. Lord Sandwich, it
is said, will be secretary for some weeks; our friend Wood is
so at present. Many of the leading men in the opposition were
left out on Mr. Pitt's plan; which, it is thought, will breed
dissensions among them.</p>

<p>"I dined yesterday with Lord Chesterfield, along with Colonel
Irvine. The Colonel made an apology for our arriving so late,
on account of his being detained at court. 'At court?' said my
lord: 'I should be glad to know what place that is.' Dear
Mure, yours."<a name="FNanchor_160:1_135" id="FNanchor_160:1_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_160:1_135" class="fnanchor">[160:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In an earlier part of this work, we have found Hume narrating events of
contemporary military history. In the following, as in the preceding
letter, he gives his version of a celebrated ministerial revolution, of
which the public is as yet possessed of no account which is not liable
to doubt.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Lisle St. 13th Sept. 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;The settlement which I had made in Scotland
was so much to my mind, I had indeed struck root so heartily,
that it was with the <!-- Page 161 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_161" id="Page_v2_161">[161]</a></span>utmost reluctance I could think of
transplanting myself, and I began to approach towards that age
in which these experiments became no longer practicable with
safety. I own that, on my arrival in London, I found every
circumstance more inviting than I had reason to expect;
particularly the characters of Lord and Lady Hertford, who are
allowed to be the two persons the most unexceptionable among
all the English nobility. Even that circumstance of Lord
Hertford's character, his great piety, ought to make my
connexions with him more agreeable, both because it is not
attended with any thing sour and rigid, and because I draw the
more honour from his choice, while he overlooked so many
seeming objections which lay against me on that head. My
fortune also receives a great addition during life from this
connexion; besides many openings to ambition, were I so simple
as to be exposed to temptation from that passion.</p>

<p>"But, notwithstanding all these considerations, shall I tell
you the truth? I repine at my loss of ease and leisure, and
retirement and independence; and it is not without a sigh I
look backwards, nor without reluctance that I cast my eye
forwards. Is this sentiment an instinct which admonishes me of
the situation most proper and suitable to me? Or is it a
momentary disgust, the effect of low spirits, which company
and amusement, and a better state of health, will soon
dissipate and remove? I must wait with patience till I see the
decision of this question.</p>

<p>"I find that one view of Lord Hertford in engaging me to go
along with him is, that he thinks I may be useful to Lord
Beauchamp in his studies. That young nobleman is generally
spoke of as very amiable and very promising; but I remember,
though faintly, <!-- Page 162 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_162" id="Page_v2_162">[162]</a></span>to have heard from you something to the
contrary, which you had heard from that severe critic, Mr.
Herbert: I should be obliged to you for informing me of it. I
have not yet seen my Lord Beauchamp, who is at this time in
Paris. We shall not leave London these three weeks.</p>

<p>"You have, no doubt, heard of the strange jumble among our
ministers, and of the negotiation opened with Mr. Pitt. Never
story was told with such contrary circumstances as that of his
secret conference with the king, and of the terms demanded by
that popular leader. The general outlines of the whole story
seem to be these:</p>

<p>"Lord Bute, disgusted with the ministers, who had almost
universally conspired to neglect him, and suspecting their
bottom to be too narrow, had, before Lord Egremont's death,
opened a negotiation with Mr. Pitt, by means of Lord
Shelburne, who employed Calcraft the agent. Mr. Pitt says,
that he always declared it highly improper that he should be
brought to the king, before all terms were settled on such a
footing as to render it impossible for them to separate
without agreeing. He accordingly thought they were settled.
His first conference with the king confirmed him in that
opinion, and he wrote to the Duke of Devonshire to come to
town, in order to place himself at the head of the treasury.
The Duke of Newcastle said, at his table on Sunday was a
fortnight, that the ministry was settled. But when Mr. Pitt
came to the king that afternoon, he found him entirely
changed, and every thing was retracted that had been agreed
on. This is his story. The other party says, that he rose in
his terms, and wanted to impose the most exorbitant conditions
on his sovereign. I suppose that the first conference passed
chiefly in generals, and that <!-- Page 163 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_163" id="Page_v2_163">[163]</a></span>Mr. Pitt would then be
extremely humble, and submissive, and polite, and dutiful in
his expressions. But when he came to particulars, they did not
seem to correspond with these appearances. At least, this is
the best account I can devise of the matter, consistent with
the honour of both parties.</p>

<p>"You would see the present ministry by the papers. It is
pretended that they are enraged against Lord Bute, for
negotiating without their knowledge or consent; and that the
other party are no less displeased with him for not finishing
the treaty with them. That nobleman declared his resolution of
going abroad a week or two ago. Now he is determined to pass
the winter in London. Our countrymen are visibly hurt in this
justle of parties, which I believe to be far from the
intentions of Lord Bute. Lord Shelburne resigned, because he
found himself obnoxious on account of his share in the
negotiation. I see you are much displeased with that nobleman,
but he always speaks of you with regard. I hear that your
pupil, Mr. Fitzmaurice, makes a very good figure at Paris.</p>

<p>"It is generally thought that Mr. Pitt has gained credit and
force by this negotiation. It turns the eyes of the public
towards him. It shows that the king can overlook personal
resentment against him and Lord Temple. It gains him the
confidence of his own party, who see that he was negotiating
for the whole of them; and puts people in mind of the French
rhyme,&mdash;<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ville qui parle et femme qui écoute</i>.</p>

<p>"You would hear that the case of the Douglas is now made
clear, even in the eyes the most blinded and most prejudiced,
which I am glad of on account of our friends. I am,"
&amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_163:1_136" id="FNanchor_163:1_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_163:1_136" class="fnanchor">[163:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 164 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_164" id="Page_v2_164">[164]</a></span>The following notice, by one who has unfortunately left nothing behind
to show posterity the grounds on which his reputation rested, the Rev.
Dr. Carlyle, will be read with interest.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Robertson has managed with great address: he is principal,
chaplain, minister, historiographer, and historian; that is to
say, he has £50 a-year and a house, certain, besides what he
can make by his books. It was taken for granted that he was to
resign his charge on being appointed historiographer with £200
salary; but that he will do at his leisure. It is also
supposed by his patrons, that he is to write the History of
Britain in ten volumes quarto; that also, I presume, (dreadful
task,) he will execute at his leisure.</p>

<p>Honest David Home, [Hume,] with the heart of all others that
rejoices most at the prosperity of his friends, was certainly
a little hurt with this last honour conferred on Robertson. A
lucky accident has given him relief. The Earl of Hertford is
appointed ambassador to France: not very capable himself, they
have loaded him with an insignificant secretary, one Charles
Bunbury, who, for the sake of pleasure, more than the thousand
a-year, solicited for the office. Hertford knew David, and
some good genius prompted him to ask him to go along and
manage the business. It is an honourable character: he will
see his friends in France. If he tires, he can return when he
pleases. Bunbury will probably tire first, and then David will
become secretary.<a name="FNanchor_164:1_137" id="FNanchor_164:1_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_164:1_137" class="fnanchor">[164:1]</a></p>

<p>The following letter, without address, appears to have been written to
Dr. Carlyle.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Lisle Street, 15th Sept. 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;The case of poor Blacklock gives me great
distress; and so much the more, as I am afraid it is not in
the power of any human being to <!-- Page 165 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_165" id="Page_v2_165">[165]</a></span>relieve him.<a name="FNanchor_165:1_138" id="FNanchor_165:1_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_165:1_138" class="fnanchor">[165:1]</a> His
unhappiness seems to proceed from the infirmity of his body,
and the delicacy, not to say weakness, of his mind. He has
wrote to me letters full of the bitterest anguish, on account
of the treatment he meets with from his parishioners. I
believe it is not good; but it is impossible not to think it
exaggerated by his imagination: and I am of your opinion that
the same persecution, partly real, partly imaginary, would
follow him in every other settlement. I had concerted with
Baron Mure a very likely scheme for his removal; but to what
purpose would this serve, if the same complaints must return
in his new situation? I agree with you, that a small pension,
could it be obtained, might bestow on him some degree of
tranquillity; but how to obtain it I profess I do not know, as
I suppose you will readily believe. That door was never very
wide for men of letters; and is become still narrower than
ever."</p>
</div>

<p>He proceeds, in terms similar to those already recorded, to state his
satisfaction in the connexion with Lord Hertford, and continues:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I go to a place of the world which I have always admired the
most; and it is not easy to imagine a reception better than I
have reason to expect. What, then, can be wanting to my
happiness? I hope, nothing; <!-- Page 166 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_166" id="Page_v2_166">[166]</a></span>or if any thing, it will only be
an age and temper better adapted to vanity and dissipation. I
beg of you to embrace Mrs. Carlisle in my name, and to assure
her of my sincere respects.</p>

<p>"I write no politics, having now become a politician. Please
address yourself to John Hume for information on that head.
Let him explain to you his patron's situation!!!! Pray, is
there any body such an idiot at present as to be a partisan of

</div>

<p>To obtain literary distinction in France at that time, was to be
received at court. The star of Germany had not yet risen in the horizon
of literature, and the great monarch and warrior of the Teutonic tribes
treated his native tongue as the speech of boors, tried to distinguish
himself in French literature, and was ambitious of being received into
equal companionship with the popular authors of France. Britain,
notwithstanding her series of illustrious names, had not yet quite
shaken off an air of provincialism. Shakspere was a strange wild genius,
full of barbarisms and abominable galimatias: Voltaire had said it, and
it was a judgment, not an opinion. Some discontented Frerons or Arnauds,
might cavil against it: but this was rebellion, not controversy. The
greatness of our masters in science and philosophy was fully admitted;
but they were viewed as citizens of the great world of letters,
accidentally born in one of its more barren districts; and they were
scarcely more closely identified with the national literature of their
country, than Linnæus might be with that of Sweden, or Tycho Brahe with
that of Denmark. In truth, the apparent interregnum, following the
decline of the Latin as the literary language of the world, appeared
likely to end in the establishment of the French as its successor. Such
expectations gave to the literature of France a <!-- Page 167 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_167" id="Page_v2_167">[167]</a></span>metropolitan air, with
which no other could cope; and communicated to those natives of other
places, whose name was honoured in the French circles of letters, a
corresponding elevation.<a name="FNanchor_167:1_139" id="FNanchor_167:1_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:1_139" class="fnanchor">[167:1]</a> Hume would have been impervious to the
most conclusive evidence on the subject, if he had failed to know how
greatly he was honoured among all the literary circles of the continent,
and particularly in those of the metropolis of literature. Lord Elibank,
writing from Paris, on 11th May, 1763, says to him, "No author ever yet
attained to that degree of reputation in his own lifetime that you are
now in possession of at Paris;"<a name="FNanchor_167:2_140" id="FNanchor_167:2_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:2_140" class="fnanchor">[167:2]</a> and the extent of his fame was
abundantly attested by others.<a name="FNanchor_167:3_141" id="FNanchor_167:3_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_167:3_141" class="fnanchor">[167:3]</a></p>

<p>Hume arrived in France on the 14th day of October, 1763. Of his
reception, his own letters will give the best account.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Fontainbleau, 26th Oct. 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I have been three days at Paris, and two at
Fontainbleau, and have every where met with the most
extraordinary honours, <!-- Page 169 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_169" id="Page_v2_169">[169]</a></span>which the most exorbitant vanity could
wish or desire. The compliments of dukes and marischals of
France, and foreign ambassadors, go for nothing with me at
present: I retain a relish for no kind of flattery but that
which comes from the ladies. All the courtiers, who stood
around when I was introduced to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Pompadour</span>, assured
me that she was never heard to say so much to any man; and her
brother, to whom she introduced me,&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_169:1_142" id="FNanchor_169:1_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_169:1_142" class="fnanchor">[169:1]</a> But I forget
already, that I am to scorn all the civilities of men.
However, even <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Pompadour's</span> civilities were, if possible,
exceeded by those of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse de Choiseul</span>, the wife of the
favourite and Prime Minister, and one of the ladies of the
most distinguished merit in France. Not contented with the
many obliging things she said to me on my first introduction,
she sent to call me from the other end of the room, in order
to repeat them, and to enter into a short conversation with
me: and not contented with that, she sent the Danish
ambassador after me, to assure me, that what she said was not
from politeness, but that she seriously desired to be in
friendship <!-- Page 170 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_170" id="Page_v2_170">[170]</a></span>and correspondence with me. There is not a
courtier in France, who would not have been transported with
joy, to have had the half of these obliging things said to him
by either of these great ladies; but what may appear more
extraordinary, both of them, as far as I could conjecture,
have read with some care all my writings that have been
translated into French,&mdash;that is, almost all my writings. The
king said nothing particular to me, when I was introduced to
him; and (can you imagine it) I was become so silly, as to be
a little mortified by it, till they told me, that he never
says any thing to any body the first time he sees them. The
Dauphin, as I am told from all hands, declares himself on
every occasion very strongly in my favour; and many people
assure me, that I have reason to be proud of his judgment,
even were he an individual. I have scarce seen any of the
geniuses of Paris, who, I think, have in general great merit,
as men of letters. But every body is forward to tell me the
high panegyrics I receive from them; and you may believe that
&mdash;&mdash;<a name="FNanchor_170:1_143" id="FNanchor_170:1_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_170:1_143" class="fnanchor">[170:1]</a> approbation which has procured me all these
civilities from the courtiers.</p>

<p>"I know you are ready to ask me, my dear friend, if all this
does not make me very happy: No, I feel little or no
difference. As this is the first letter I write to my friends
at home, I have amused myself, (and I hope I have amused you,)
by giving you a very abridged account of these transactions.
But can I ever forget, that it is the very same species, that
would scarce show me common civilities a very few years ago at
Edinburgh, who now receive me with such applauses at Paris? I
assure you, I reap more internal satisfaction from the very
amiable manners <!-- Page 171 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_171" id="Page_v2_171">[171]</a></span>and character of the family in which I live,
(I mean Lord and Lady Hertford, and Lord Beauchamp,) than from
all these external vanities; and it is that domestic enjoyment
which must be considered as the agreeable circumstance in my
situation. During the two last days, in particular, that I
have been at Fontainbleau I have <em>suffered</em> (the expression is
not improper) as much flattery as almost any man has ever done
in the same time. But there are few days in my life, when I
have been in good health, that I would not rather pass over
again. Mr. Neville, our minister, an honest, worthy English
gentleman, who carried me about, was astonished at the
civilities I met with; and has assured me, that on his return,
he will not fail to inform the king of England and the English
ministry of all these particulars. But enough of all these
follies. You see I trust to your friendship, that you will
forgive me; and to your discretion, that you will keep my
secret.</p>

<p>"I had almost forgot, in these effusions, shall I say of my
misanthropy or my vanity, to mention the subject which first
put my pen in my hand. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron d'Holbach</span>, whom I saw at
Paris, told me, that there was one under his eye that was
translating your 'Theory of Moral Sentiments;' and desired me
to inform you of it.<a name="FNanchor_171:1_144" id="FNanchor_171:1_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_171:1_144" class="fnanchor">[171:1]</a> Mr. Fitzmaurice, your old friend,
interests himself strongly in this undertaking. Both of them
wish to know, if you propose to make any alterations on the
work, and desire you to inform me of your intentions in that
particular. Please direct to me under cover to the Earl of
Hertford at Northumberland House, London. Letters so directed
will be sent to us at Paris. I desire my compliments <!-- Page 172 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_172" id="Page_v2_172">[172]</a></span>to all
friends. I am, my dear Smith, yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_172:1_145" id="FNanchor_172:1_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_172:1_145" class="fnanchor">[172:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Professor Ferguson</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Fontainbleau, 9th Nov. 1763.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Ferguson</span>,&mdash;I have now passed four days at Paris, and
about a fortnight in the court at Fontainbleau, amidst a
people who, from the royal family downwards, seem to have it
much at heart to persuade me, by every expression of esteem,
that they consider me as one of the greatest geniuses in the
world. I am convinced that Louis XIV. never, in any three
weeks of his life, suffered so much flattery: I say suffered,
for it really confounds and embarrasses me, and makes me look
sheepish. Lord Hertford has told them they will chase me out
of France, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">à coup de complimens et de louanges</i>. Our friend,
General Clerk, came to this place after I had passed a week in
it; and the first thing he said to me was, that he was sure I
had never passed so many days with so little satisfaction. I
asked him how he had happened to guess so well. He said,
because he knew me, and knew the French. I really wish often
for the plain roughness of the <em>Poker</em>,<a name="FNanchor_172:2_146" id="FNanchor_172:2_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_172:2_146" class="fnanchor">[172:2]</a> and
particularly the sharpness of Dr. Jardine, to correct and
qualify so much lusciousness. However, I meet sometimes with
incidents that please me, because they contain no mixture of
French complaisance or exaggeration. Yesterday I dined at the
Duc de Praslin's, the secretary of state. After we had risen
from dinner, <!-- Page 173 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_173" id="Page_v2_173">[173]</a></span>I went into a corner to converse with somebody;
when I saw enter the room, a tall gentleman, a little elderly,
with a riband and star, who immediately called out to the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse de Praslin, 'Hé, Madame la Duchesse, que je suis
content, j'ai vu Monsieur Hume à la cour aujourd'hui.</span>' Upon
inquiry, I was told he was a man of quality, esteemed one of
the cleverest and most sensible about the court.</p>

<p>"In two or three days we return to Paris, where I hope to live
more at my ease, and shall pass my time with really great men;
for there are such at present amongst the literati of France.
Certainly there is something perverse, either in the structure
of our mind, or in the incidents of life. My present situation
ought naturally to appear an object of envy; for besides those
circumstances of an universal good reception from all ranks of
people, nothing can be more amiable than the character of the
family with whom I live, and nothing can be more friendly than
their behaviour to me. My fortune has already received a
considerable increase by a pension procured me by Lord
Hertford, and settled as they tell me for life. Mr. Bunbury
has been told that he must not go to Paris, which my lord
considers as a sure prelude to my being soon secretary to the
embassy; an office which will expose me to little expense, and
bring me a thousand a-year increase of revenue, and puts me in
the road to all the great foreign employments. Yet I am
sensible that I set out too late, and that I am misplaced; and
I wish, twice or thrice a-day, for my easy chair and my
retreat in James's Court! Never think, dear Ferguson, that as
long as you are master of your own fireside and your own time,
you can be unhappy, or that any other circumstance can make an
addition to your enjoyment.</p>

<p>"When I think of my own house, you may believe <!-- Page 174 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_174" id="Page_v2_174">[174]</a></span>I often
reflect on Josey, who I am afraid will be more a loser by my
absence, than ever I shall be a gainer by it; I mean in point
of his education. I beg of you to have some inspection over
him, and as often as my sister shall send to you to ask your
advice, that you will be sure to give it. I am afraid that
there occurs a difficulty at present about entering him to the
Greek. He is too far advanced by his learning for the class in
the High School to which he is put, and yet he is too young to
go to the college: for this reason I thought that he might
learn something of the Greek before he finished his Latin
course, as is the practice in England; and, accordingly,
Murray in Musselburgh gave him some lessons in that language.
I propose that he should continue on the same footing in
Edinburgh; but I am at a loss how it may be done. A master to
himself alone, would not give him any emulation; and were he
put to any other school for this purpose, the hours would
interfere with those of the High School. Be so good as speak
to Mathison, and then give your opinion to my sister.</p>

<p>"Please remember me to Mr. and Mrs. Adams.<a name="FNanchor_174:1_147" id="FNanchor_174:1_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_174:1_147" class="fnanchor">[174:1]</a> I saw Willie
a moment at Fontainbleau: he had arrived a quarter of an hour
after Jemmy left it, whom I did not see. These two brothers
have been hunting one another in vain through all France; but
I hope they have met at last in Paris.</p>

<p>"When you favour me with a letter, put it under cover to the
Earl of Hertford, and direct it to him at Northumberland
House, in the Strand; letters so directed come to us with the
greatest safety. Make <!-- Page 175 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_175" id="Page_v2_175">[175]</a></span>my compliments to Baron Mure, and Mrs.
Mure, and all that family. I shall write to the Baron soon.
Tell Dr. Blair that I have conversed here twice or thrice with
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse D'Aiguillon</span>, who has been amusing herself with
translating passages of Ossian; and I have assured her that
the authenticity of those poems is to be proved soon beyond
all contradiction. Andrew Stuart is here at present: I meet
with nobody here that doubts of the justice of his cause. I
hope your fine judges will at last be ashamed of their
scandalous partiality. I should be glad to hear of all
friends. I am, dear Ferguson, with great sincerity and without
flattery, your affectionate friend and servant.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I beg you to keep the follies of the above letter to
yourself. I had a letter from Lord Marischal to-day, who tells
me that he is to pass the winter at Edinburgh. Wait often on
him; you will like him extremely: carry all our friends to
him, and endeavour to make him pass his time as agreeably as
possible."<a name="FNanchor_175:1_148" id="FNanchor_175:1_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_175:1_148" class="fnanchor">[175:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We shall have farther opportunities of observing the affectionate
anxiety with which Hume watched over the education of his nephews. Adam
Ferguson appears to have undertaken the task of noticing the progress of
Joseph, the elder nephew, during Hume's absence, to whom he writes, in
answer to the above:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Edinburgh, 26th Nov. 1763.</p>

<p>At present his journal, as he tells me, begins with getting up
at eight, taking his breakfast and going to school, where he
remains to eleven. Then to the High School Yard to play at
Englishman and Scotsman, or the hare and the dogs; of which I
take the merit, as I saved him from the writing-school at that
hour. He returns to school at twelve, and continues till two:
goes to writing between three <!-- Page 176 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_176" id="Page_v2_176">[176]</a></span>and four; and spends his
evenings, as he tells me, in getting his school tasks, or in
reading amusing books,&mdash;such as his uncle's history. In short,
he is a very amiable boy, with quick parts, in my opinion as
well as yours; and there is no doubt but he will do well. I am
very glad of every thing that gives you pleasure,&mdash;even of
some things that give you pain. From all accounts, both before
and since you went to Paris, it might be foreseen that your
reception, even from sincere as well as affected admirers,
would amount to a degree of teasing. But all for the best, as
my fellow philosopher, Pangloss, says. I don't care if you are
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chassé de France à coups de complimens, et accablé en
Angleterre à coups de richesse</span>," so as not to find any rest to
the soles of your feet out of Scotland. I would fain consider
every accession to your fortune as so many dishes added to the
future dinners in James's Court; and your eclat in France, as
the forerunner of much variety of chosen and excellent wines
from every quarter of that great kingdom. Meantime, though I
like to lounge at firesides in practice, I have not, in
speculation, that opinion you mention. I know nothing that is
necessary to happiness but cordiality and the talent of
finding diversion in all places. I remember, somewhere, a
man's being told that he was too nice, because he could not
dine on a ragout, and must have cold mutton. But I should not,
perhaps, contradict you so flatly, nor rub so hard,
considering how tender your sensibility will be grown after so
many lenient applications.<a name="FNanchor_176:1_149" id="FNanchor_176:1_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_176:1_149" class="fnanchor">[176:1]</a></p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Robertson</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Paris, Dec. 1, 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Robertson</span>,&mdash;Among other agreeable circumstances which
attend me at Paris, I must mention that of having a lady for a
translator; a woman of merit, the widow of an advocate.<a name="FNanchor_176:2_150" id="FNanchor_176:2_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_176:2_150" class="fnanchor">[176:2]</a>
She was, before, very poor, and known but to <!-- Page 177 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_177" id="Page_v2_177">[177]</a></span>few; but this
work has got her reputation, and procured her a pension from
the court, which sets her at ease. She tells me that she has
got a habit of industry; and would continue, if I could point
out to her any other English book she could undertake, without
running the risk of being anticipated by any other translator.
Your "History of Scotland" is translated, and is in the press;
but I recommended to her your "History of Charles V.," and
promised to write to you, in order to know when it would be
printed, and to desire you to send over the sheets from
London, as they come from the press; I should put them into
her hands, and she would, by that means, have the start of
every other translator.<a name="FNanchor_177:1_151" id="FNanchor_177:1_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_177:1_151" class="fnanchor">[177:1]</a> My two volumes last published,
are, at present, in the press. She has a very easy natural
style: sometimes she mistakes the sense; but I now correct her
manuscript, and should be happy to render you the same
service, if my leisure permit me, as I hope it will.</p>

<p>Do you ask me about my course of life? I can only say, that I
eat nothing but ambrosia, drink nothing but nectar, breathe
nothing but incense, and tread on nothing but flowers! Every
man I meet, and, still more, every lady, would think they were
wanting in the most indispensable duty, if they did not make a
long and elaborate harangue in my praise. What happened last
week, when I had the honour of being presented to the D&mdash;&mdash;n's
children, at Versailles, is one of the most curious scenes I
have yet passed through. The Duc de B., the eldest, a boy of
ten years old, stepped forth, and <!-- Page 178 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_178" id="Page_v2_178">[178]</a></span>told me how many friends
and admirers I had in this country, and that he reckoned
himself in the number, from the pleasure he had received from
the reading of many passages in my works. When he had
finished, his brother, the Count de P., who is two years
younger, began his discourse, and informed me, that I had been
long and impatiently expected in France; and that he himself
expected soon to have great satisfaction from the reading of
my fine History. But what is more curious; when I was carried
thence to the Count D'A., who is but four years of age, I
heard him mumble something which, though he had forgot in the
way, I conjectured, from some scattered words, to have been
also a panegyric dictated to him. Nothing could more surprise
my friends, the Parisian philosophers, than this incident.</p>

<hr class="thoughtbreak" />

<p>It is conjectured that this honour was paid me by express
order from the D.<a name="FNanchor_178:1_152" id="FNanchor_178:1_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_178:1_152" class="fnanchor">[178:1]</a>, who, indeed, is not on any occasion
sparing in my praise.</p>

<p>All this attention and panegyric was at first oppressive to
me; but now it sits more easy. I have recovered, in some
measure, the use of the language, and am falling into
friendships which are very agreeable; much more so than silly,
distant admiration. They now begin to banter me, and tell
droll stories of me, which they have either observed
themselves, or have heard from others; so that you see I am
beginning to be at home. It is probable that this place will
be long my home. I feel little inclination to the factious
<!-- Page 179 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_179" id="Page_v2_179">[179]</a></span>barbarians of London; and have ever desired to remain in the
place where I am planted. How much more so, when it is the
best place in the world? I could here live in great abundance
on the half of my income; for there is no place where money is
so little requisite to a man who is distinguished, either by
his birth or by personal qualities. I could run out, you see,
in a panegyric on the people; but you would suspect that this
was a mutual convention between us. However, I cannot forbear
observing on what a different footing learning and the learned
are here, from what they are among the factious barbarians
abovementioned.</p>

<p>I have here met with a prodigious historical curiosity, the
"Memoirs of King James II." in fourteen volumes, all wrote
with his own hand, and kept in the Scots College. I have
looked into it; and have made great discoveries.<a name="FNanchor_179:1_153" id="FNanchor_179:1_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:1_153" class="fnanchor">[179:1]</a> It
will be all communicated to me: and I have had an offer of
access to the Secretary of State's office, if I want to know
the despatches of any French minister that resided in London.
But these matters are much out of my head. I beg of you to
visit Lord Marischal, who will be pleased with your company. I
have little paper remaining, and less time; and therefore
conclude abruptly by assuring you that I am, dear Doctor,
yours sincerely, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_179:2_154" id="FNanchor_179:2_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_179:2_154" class="fnanchor">[179:2]</a></p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Paris, 1st Dec. 1763.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have here fallen upon a great treasure, as I
believe, of historical knowledge; which is, fifteen volumes of
the late King James's Memoirs, wrote all with his own hand. I
shall be able to make use of them for improving and
<!-- Page 180 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_180" id="Page_v2_180">[180]</a></span>correcting many passages of my History, in case of a new
edition; which, however, I fancy will not be soon. I am glad
to see public affairs likely to settle in favour of
government. Nobody ever led a more dissipated life than I do
here. Please send to Mr. Stewart, in Buckingham Street, six
copies of the new edition of my History; and two of the last
large paper quarto, all in sheets. Make them carefully up in a
parcel: he is to send them to me. I shall be your debtor for
the quartos. I should be glad to hear from you. My direction
is at the English ambassador's. Excuse my hurry. I beg my
compliments to Mrs. Millar. I am, very sincerely, dear sir,
your most humble servant.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.<a name="FNanchor_180:1_155" id="FNanchor_180:1_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_180:1_155" class="fnanchor">[180:1]</a></p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I write every thing in haste, except on public
affairs, which are the only serious matters I have leisure to
mind: so, excuse this letter, if it prove a scrawl. I approve
very much of your plan for ascertaining the authenticity of
Ossian's Poems; and I doubt not of your success. I do not
think you can publish all the letters you receive, which
nobody would read: a summary of them will do better; but
endeavour to be as particular as you can with regard to names
of persons and passages: for the force of your argument will
be there. I have met here with enthusiasts for Ossian's
poetry; but there are also several critics who are of my
opinion, that, though great beauties, they are also great
curiosities, and that they are a little tedious by reason of
their uniformity.</p>

<p>You desire to know the particulars of my reception here, and
my course of life. I own I write little upon this subject, and
always with some degree of secrecy, both because I wish to
have such intelligence conveyed by others rather than myself,
and because I am somewhat indifferent whether it be conveyed
or not. However, I wrote some circumstances to Robertson,
which I allow him to communicate to you. I suppose this, like
all other violent modes, will pass; and, in the meanwhile, the
hurry and dissipation attending it, gives me more pain than
pleasure. Never was there a stronger <!-- Page 181 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_181" id="Page_v2_181">[181]</a></span>instance of the vanity
of human wishes. But this embarrassment proceeds chiefly from
my own fault, and from a vain anxiety to give no offence nor
displeasure to any body.</p>

<p>The men of letters here are really very agreeable: all of them
men of the world, living in entire, or almost entire harmony
among themselves, and quite irreproachable in their morals. It
would give you, and Jardine, and Robertson, great satisfaction
to find that there is not a single deist among them. Those
whose persons and conversation I like best, are D'Alembert,
Buffon, Marmontel, Diderot, Duclos, Helvetius, and old
President Henault, who, though now decaying, retains that
amiable character which made him once the delight of all
France. He had always the best cook and the best company in
Paris. But though I know you will laugh at me, as they do, I
must confess that I am more carried away from their society
than I should be, by the great ladies, with whom I became
acquainted at my first introduction to court, and whom my
connexions with the English ambassador will not allow me
entirely to drop.</p>

<p>Nothing can be more easy and agreeable than my situation with
Lord Hertford, who is a man of strict honour, an amiable
temper, a good understanding, and an elegant person and
behaviour. He takes very much in this place. He has got an
opinion very well founded, that the more acquaintance I make,
and the greater intimacies I form with the French, the more I
am enabled to be of service to him: so he exacts no attendance
from me; and is well pleased to find me carried into all kinds
of company. He tells me, that if he did not meet me by chance
in third places, we should go out of acquaintance. Thus you
see my present plan of life sketched out; but it is unsuitable
to my age and temper; and I am determined to retrench and to
abandon the fine folks, before they abandon me.<a name="FNanchor_181:1_156" id="FNanchor_181:1_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_181:1_156" class="fnanchor">[181:1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>During his absence, Hume's house was let to Blair. In this letter he
gives pretty minute instructions as to the most advantageous
distribution of the occupation of the apartments, which incidentally
illustrate his own domestic habits. Thus&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p><!-- Page 182 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_182" id="Page_v2_182">[182]</a></span>Never put a fire in the south room with the red paper. It is
so warm of itself, that all last winter, which was a very
severe one, I lay with a single blanket; and frequently upon
coming in at midnight, starving with cold, have sat down and
read for an hour, as if I had had a stove in the room.</p>

<p>You think it inconvenient to take the house only for an
interval. Alas! my prospects of being home are very distant
and very uncertain: I am afraid I might say worse. My
connexions with Lord Hertford must probably last for some
years; after which, I shall be rich enough to live in Paris or
London as I please, or to retire to a provincial town in
France, or to Bath, or God knows whither. I like to keep my
house in case of accidents, and therefore neither choose to
sell it, nor let a lease of it; but there is no great chance
of your being disturbed in it for some time. I am, &amp;c.</p>

excellent a man? or that you have any chance for seeing his

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel Edmondstoune</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Paris, 9th January, 1764.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Edmondstoune</span>,&mdash;I was fully settled, and, as I thought,
for life at Edinburgh; had bought a very pretty little house,
which I had repaired and furnished to my fancy; had purchased
a chaise, and fixed every thing about my family on such a
footing as to continue there the rest of my days. But while I
was in this situation, which was far from disagreeable, I
received a letter from my friend Mr. Wood, wrote by directions
from Lord Hertford, by which I was invited to attend his
lordship in his embassy to Paris, and to perform the
<!-- Page 183 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_183" id="Page_v2_183">[183]</a></span>functions of secretary to the embassy. I had never seen Lord
Hertford, though I had heard an excellent character of him;
but as I thought myself too old to enter on a new scene of
life, and found myself settled to my mind, I at first refused
the invitation; but on its being urged more home to me, I came
up to London, where I found that Mr. Bunbury, a gentleman of
considerable fortune, and married to the Duke of Richmond's
sister, had already been appointed secretary; but was so
disagreeable to the ambassador, that he was resolved never to
see, or do business with his secretary, and therefore desired
I should attend him, in order to perform the functions. He
also thought himself certain that Bunbury could not possibly
continue in the situation; but in order to make me more
secure, he procured me a pension of £200 a-year for life, from
the king. As I became every day better acquainted with my
lord, I liked him every day better; and I do not believe there
is in the world a man of more probity or humanity, endowed
with a very good understanding, and adorned with very elegant
manners and behaviour. My lady is also a person of great
merit; and nothing can be more amiable than my Lord Beauchamp:
so that you see I have every domestic means of happiness; and
the good reception I have met with at Paris, particularly, as
you observe, by the ladies, renders my present course of life,
though somewhat too hurried and dissipated, as amusing as I
could wish. My lord appears zealously my friend, and has urged
the matter so home, in my favour, to the king and the
ministers, that he has obtained a promise, that I shall soon
have the appointments and commission of secretary to the
embassy, which is about £1000 a-year, added to what I already
possess: so that you see, dear Edmondstoune, I am in the high
road to riches; and as there is no instance of a secretary to
the embassy at Paris, that has not been advanced to the most
considerable employments, I am at the same time in the high
road to dignities. You must know, that Lord Hertford has so
high a character for piety, that his taking me by the hand is
a kind of regeneration to me, and all past offences are now
wiped off. But all these views are trifling to one of my age
and temper. The material point is (if any thing can be
material,) that I keep my health and humour as entire as I
<!-- Page 184 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_184" id="Page_v2_184">[184]</a></span>possessed them at five and-twenty. I am sorry to hear, dear
Edmondstoune, that the case is not the same with you, at least
with regard to the former; and perhaps somewhat with regard to
the latter. Your situation is no doubt tiresome, and somewhat
disagreeable. What is the fancy of sending one of the first
noblemen in the kingdom to pass years in a country
town?<a name="FNanchor_184:1_158" id="FNanchor_184:1_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:1_158" class="fnanchor">[184:1]</a> why do you not go forward to Italy, or back to
Paris? When I arrived here, all M. Voltaire's friends told me
of the regard he always expressed for me; that some advances
on my part were due to his age, and would be well taken. I
accordingly wrote him a letter, in which I expressed the
esteem which are<a name="FNanchor_184:2_159" id="FNanchor_184:2_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:2_159" class="fnanchor">[184:2]</a> undoubtedly due to his talents; and
among other things I said, that if I were not confined to
Paris by public business, I should have a great ambition to
pay him a visit at Geneva. This is the foundation of the
report you mention; but I am absolutely confined to Paris and
the court, and cannot on any account leave them so much as for
three days.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Some advice, given at this time by Hume to a young man who, though in
holy orders, had a tendency to scepticism, has already been before the
public, and has been severely criticised. His view, that there are
certain secrets which may be circulated among the learned in published
books, without any risk that the vulgar, to whom a knowledge of them
would be dangerous, should ever become acquainted with them, is one of
the most incomprehensible features of his character.<a name="FNanchor_184:3_160" id="FNanchor_184:3_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_184:3_160" class="fnanchor">[184:3]</a> The
application of his own ethical system to the circumstances, might have
taught him that no good thing can connect itself with a lie; and that,
independently of all more sacred considerations, nothing can be more
desolating to human morality, than the discovery, that those who are
professing to <!-- Page 185 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_185" id="Page_v2_185">[185]</a></span>teach solemn truths, do not themselves believe in the
opinions they promulgate. If, on the other hand, his counsel be a
legitimate deduction from his ethical principles, it is right that the
world should possess this test of their nature.</p>

<p>The following is the correspondence on both sides. For obvious reasons
the name of the young clergyman is suppressed. It may be observed, that
Hume's letter has been made a ground for attributing infidel opinions to
the ministers of the Presbyterian Church of Scotland. But justice
requires it to be kept in view, that it appears from the immediately
ensuing letter, that this individual belonged to the Church of
<em>England</em>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Geneva, 26th March.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Secretary</span>,&mdash;I have delayed for some time answering
your letter, in expectation of being able to tell you what is
to become of me; whether I am to return home, or remain abroad
some years longer. Though I believe the latter will happen, I
cannot speak of it with certainty, as I left it to Lord B. to
determine for me; and he has not, as yet, given me any answer.
I write to you at present to consult you about an acquaintance
of yours, Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;, who is here with Lord Abingdon, and who
thinks of returning to England, May next. You'll be so good as
to determine for him what character he is to assume on his
arrival, whether that of a clergyman or a layman. I suppose
you know he is in orders, but he is very very low church. To
speak plain language, I believe him to be a sort of disciple
of your own; and, though he does not carry matters quite so
far as you, yet you have given him notions not very consistent
with his priestly character; so that you see you are somewhat
bound to give him your best advice. V&mdash;&mdash; is a very
good-natured, sensible, honest follow, without any fortune. My
young man has a great liking for him, and has all the
inclination in the world to serve him; but he neither knows
what to ask for him, and is not sure if his father would ask
<!-- Page 186 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_186" id="Page_v2_186">[186]</a></span>
any thing at present. We are as much in the dark as to what
passes in England, as if we lived in Siberia. As you know
probably something of the matter, without entering into
politics, you may give us some hints to direct us in what
manner to act, and whether we may not be of more use to our
friend in acting as auxiliaries than principals. You'll
determine whether a man of probity can accept of a living, a
bishoprick, that does not believe all the Thirty-nine
Articles; for you only can fix him: he has been hitherto
irresolute. If [I am not] mistaken, he seems rather inclined
not to be a clergyman; but you know as well, and better than I
do, how difficult it is to get any tolerable civil employment.
I mean any patent place; while as soon as you can
conveniently, and if you should determine for his being a
clergyman, throw in something consolatory on his being obliged
to renounce white stockings the rest of his life. I wait with
impatience to hear of your being made secretary to the
embassy. Shall a descendant of Gospatrick, Earl of
Northumberland, remain in the character of under-secretary? I
hope not; though I am afraid our cursed politics at home will
occasion some delay. Lord Mount Stuart offers his compliments
to you, and thanks you for the pleasure your History gave him.
You scrub, do you think we have so little taste or curiosity
as not to have your History complete? We have two copies, one
to lend, and another for our own use; they were sent us
immediately on the publication; it is almost the only book he
takes pleasure in reading. He has read it once, and has got
through four volumes the second time. By the bye, what is this
M<sup>c</sup>Caulay history? I saw in the newspapers an extract of a
preface that seemed to me to be the rhapsody of a crazy head.
I hear it is in opposition to your History. We have her sister
here, who seems to be a good sort of woman, a Mrs. Buckingham.
I wish your time would allow you to come here: you have a
great many friends; among the rest a Madame Tronchin, wife to
the procureur-general, a virtuous, generous, charitable, good
woman. She has learned English since I have been here, and can
read your History with as much ease as her own language. Her
husband is a man of merit, a man of genius; but knows you only
by the translations of your works. <!-- Page 187 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_187" id="Page_v2_187">[187]</a></span>Mallet, Professor
Bertrand, and many others, even ministers, are your friends;
even the Christians acknowledge your merit as an historian.
The Christians here are the friends of Rousseau: those that
are not, have been his persecutors; but it was not for his
religious principles. They were afraid of his breeding
disturbance in their state. I wish you could do something for
Rousseau without his knowing it. Print his works in England
for his benefit. You did not, I suppose, receive my letter on
that subject. I never received that from you, which you say
you enclosed to Sir Harry Erskine. Adieu, yours,</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Colonel Edmondstoune</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Edmondstoune</span>,&mdash;I was just projecting to write a long
letter to you, and another to Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;, when your last
obliging epistle came to hand. I immediately put pen to paper,
to assure you that the report is entirely groundless, and that
I have not lost, nor ever could have lost, a shilling by
Fairholm's bankruptcy. Poor John Adams is very deeply engaged
with him; but I had a letter last post from Dr. Blair, which
informs me that he will yet be able to save fifteen or sixteen
thousand pounds. I am glad to give you also this piece of
intelligence.</p>

<p>"What! do you know that Lord Bute is again all-powerful, or
rather that he was always so, but is now acknowledged for such
by all the world? Let this be a new motive for Mr. V&mdash;&mdash; to
adhere to the ecclesiastical profession, in which he may have
so good a patron; for civil employments for men of letters can
scarcely be found: all is occupied by men of business, or by
parliamentary interest.<a name="FNanchor_187:2_162" id="FNanchor_187:2_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_187:2_162" class="fnanchor">[187:2]</a></p>

<p>"It is putting too great a respect on the vulgar, and on their
superstitions, to pique one's self on sincerity <!-- Page 188 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_188" id="Page_v2_188">[188]</a></span>with regard
to them. Did ever one make it a point of honour to speak truth
to children or madmen. If the thing were worthy being treated
gravely, I should tell him, that the Pythian oracle, with the
approbation of Xenophon, advised every one to worship the
gods&mdash;<ins class="greek" title="nomô poleôs" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">νομω πολεως</ins>. I wish it were still in my power
to be a hypocrite in this particular. The common duties of
society usually require it; and the ecclesiastical profession
only adds a little more to an innocent dissimulation, or
rather simulation, without which it is impossible to pass
through the world. Am I a liar, because I order my servant to
say, I am not at home, when I do not desire to see company?</p>

<p>"How could you imagine that I was under-secretary to Lord
Hertford, or that I could ever be prevailed on to accept of
such a character? I am not secretary at all, but do the
business of secretary to the embassy without any character.
Bunbury has the commission and appointments: a young man of
three or four and twenty, somewhat vain and ignorant, whom
Lord Hertford refused to accept of, as thinking he would be of
no use to him. The king gave me a pension of £200 a-year for
life, to engage me to attend his lordship. My lord is very
impatient to have me secretary to the embassy; and writes very
earnest letters to that purpose to the ministers, and, among
the rest, to Lord Bute. He engaged me, somewhat against my
will, to write also to such of my friends as had credit with
that favourite, Oswald, Elliot, Sir Harry, and John Hume. The
king has promised that my Lord Hertford shall soon be
satisfied in this particular; and yet, I know not how, I
suspect that some obstacle will yet interpose; though nothing
can be more scandalous, than for a man to enjoy the revenue of
an office, which is exercised by <!-- Page 189 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_189" id="Page_v2_189">[189]</a></span>another. Mr. Bunbury has
great interest, being married to a sister of the Duke of
Richmond, and sister-in-law to Lord Holland. The appointments
of this office are above £1000 a-year, and the expense
attending it nothing; and it leads to all the great
employments. I wait the issue with patience, and even with
indifference. At my years, and with my fortune, a man with a
little common sense, without philosophy, may be indifferent
about what happens. I am, dear Edmondstoune, yours
sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_189:1_163" id="FNanchor_189:1_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_189:1_163" class="fnanchor">[189:1]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 27th March, 1764.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I believe I need not inform you how little I
have been inclined to solicit the great, or even my own
friends, for any thing that regards my own fortune. I may
venture to say, that, hitherto, I have never once made any
application of this nature: and you may wonder that now, at my
years, when the greatest part of life is past, and I may
esteem myself, in other respects, pretty much at my ease, I
should submit to prefer requests which I declined at an age
when ambition ought naturally to be stronger, and when my
circumstances much more powerfully called for assistance. But
the step I take at present is at Lord Hertford's desire; who,
being determined to make it a point that I should have the
credentials and appointments of secretary to the embassy,
expressed his wish that I should apply to all my own friends
on the same subject. My obligations to him are so great, that,
even were I more reluctant, I could not have declined
compliance; and surely I can have but small reluctance to
apply to you, one of my best <!-- Page 190 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_190" id="Page_v2_190">[190]</a></span>friends, with whom I have long
lived in a course of intimacy and good correspondence.</p>

<p>"I remember that the last time I had the pleasure of seeing
you, you said, that I no doubt wondered how it happened, that
while the prime minister and favourite, who inclined to be a
Mæcenas, and who bore me no ill will, was surrounded by all my
most particular friends, I should never have experienced any
good effects from their credit. I own that I never was
surprised; not from any diffidence in them, but from some
obvious objections. Now all these objections are removed by
Lord Hertford's friendship. Nobody, henceforth, need be afraid
to patronize me, either as a Scotchman or a Deist. This
circumstance encourages me in my present application to my
friends.</p>

<p>"Surely it is impossible to give them a juster and more
plausible cause to support than mine. I do the functions here
of secretary to the embassy: Is it not scandalous that another
should live in London and draw the salary?</p>

<p>"Is it for the credit of government, that such abuses should
appear to foreign nations? Is it good policy to send an
ambassador to the most important of all foreign employments,
and yet declare that he has so little credit at home, as not
to have the choice of his own secretary.</p>

<p>"I shall not say that the partiality I meet with here will
make these abuses more remarked, than if another person, less
known, were concerned. But surely the government puts me in a
situation which ought to render me entirely useless to my Lord
Hertford, by refusing me a character which should have
appeared necessary, in order to gain me admittance into
company.</p>

<p>"Allow me to inform you of another circumstance, <!-- Page 191 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_191" id="Page_v2_191">[191]</a></span>which
renders my prevailing on this point the most material step to
my future fortune. When I came to London, and found, contrary
to Lord Hertford's opinion, that Mr. Bunbury was likely to
keep his appointments, I declined going abroad, unless
something certain was fixed in my favour. My lord said, that
he would obtain me, from the public, a settlement of £200
a-year for life, or would give me as much from his private
fortune. He applied to the king, who agreed; to Mr. Grenville,
who also consented, two days before we came off. My pension
was fixed on the most precarious footing of all pensions, by a
simple order from the treasury to their secretary. Yet Mr.
Grenville told my lord, that this was equivalent to a
settlement for life. My lord believes so still; though I said
nothing, perhaps from a foolish delicacy, as the time of our
departure so near approached, and it was difficult then to
correct the blunder. Were I to return to England, on my
present footing, I should regard this pension as absolutely
insignificant&mdash;not worth two years' purchase; and never could
form any plan on the supposition of its duration. But had I
obtained the rank and character of secretary to the embassy,
there are certain pensions annexed, by custom, to certain
employments; and I believe I might more depend upon it.</p>

<p>"You see how materially my interests are concerned. I have
wrote to others of my friends, Sir Harry, Oswald, and John
Hume, in the same style, that an effort may be made, all at
once, in my favour. I own that, notwithstanding all the
plausible appearances, my hopes of success are but moderate. I
have been accustomed to meet with nothing but insults and
indignities from my native country; but if it continue <!-- Page 192 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_192" id="Page_v2_192">[192]</a></span>so,
'<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingrata patria, ne ossa quidem habebis</span>.' I am, my dear sir,
yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_192:1_164" id="FNanchor_192:1_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_192:1_164" class="fnanchor">[192:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>When the fame of Hume's reception in Paris had reached Scotland, some of
his countrymen, who had not previously been very solicitous to court his
notice, discovered that an introduction to him would be a valuable
acquisition. The correspondence shows that the expectations of such
persons were very large, and that if their names connected them with the
aristocracy of Scotland, it could not fail that they should be at once
put at their ease in the midst of the brilliant circle in which Hume was
moving. The following may be taken as an instance of these attempts. On
the 6th April, 1764, Blair writes:</p>

<p>"This letter will be presented to you by Colonel L&mdash;&mdash;, brother to the
Earl of L&mdash;&mdash;; who, going on a trip to Paris, is very ambitious of being
introduced to your acquaintance. You will find him a very honourable,
good-natured, well-behaved young man, of an amiable disposition and
character. As I have been much connected with the L&mdash;&mdash; family, who were
my first patrons in the ecclesiastical way, I was very glad to have it
in my power to do them this favour at their desire; and will reckon
myself much obliged to you for any civilities you show the
Colonel."<a name="FNanchor_192:2_165" id="FNanchor_192:2_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_192:2_165" class="fnanchor">[192:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 193 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_193" id="Page_v2_193">[193]</a></span>Blair was not the sole medium through whom this gentleman was
recommended. Wallace writes, on 3d April, with all due ceremony: "The
occasion of my writing at present this short letter, is a desire from
the friends of the family of L&mdash;&mdash; here, asking me to write you by this
night's post, and acquaint you that the Honourable Alexander L&mdash;&mdash;,
Esquire, son to the late Earl of L&mdash;&mdash;, lieutenant-colonel of Colonel
Carey's regiment of foot, is going to Paris, and will probably be in it
before this reaches you, and wishes you may be acquainted, before he
comes, who he is." Taking the effect of these imposing denominations for
granted, Mr. Wallace continues:&mdash;"I dare say you will introduce him to
the good company where you are, and will be ready to put him on the best
methods of enjoying and improving himself at Paris."</p>

<p>In Hume's answer to this application, we may trace some desire to
reprove any notion that he was a person so insignificant as to feel
highly honoured by an acquaintance with an Honourable, and bound as a
matter of simple etiquette to receive his proffers with grateful
eagerness.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 26th April, 1764.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Before I was favoured with yours, I had seen
Colonel L&mdash;&mdash;, who waited on me, as is usual with the British
who come to Paris. I returned his visit, and introduced him to
the ambassador, who asked him to dinner among seven or eight
of his countrymen. You will be surprised, perhaps, <!-- Page 194 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_194" id="Page_v2_194">[194]</a></span>when I
tell you that this is the utmost of the civilities which it
will ever be possible for me to show Mr. L&mdash;&mdash;. For as to the
ridiculous idea of foreigners, that I might introduce him to
the good company of Paris, nothing can be more impracticable.
I know not one family to which I could present such a man,
silent, grave, awkward, speaking ill the language, not
distinguished by any exploit, or science, or art. Were the
French houses open to such people as these, they would be very
little agreeable, considering the immense concourse of
strangers to this place. But it is quite otherwise. The people
are more scrupulous of receiving persons unknown, and I should
soon lose all credit with them, were I to prostitute my
recommendations of this nature. Your recommendations have
great weight with me; but if I am not mistaken, I have often
seen Colonel L&mdash;&mdash;'s face in Edinburgh. It is a little late he
has bethought himself of being <em>ambitious</em>, as you say, of
being introduced to my acquaintance. The only favour I can do
him, is to advise him, as soon as he has seen Paris, to go to
a provincial town where people are less shy of admitting new
acquaintance, and are less delicate judges of behaviour. It is
almost out of the memory of man, that any British has been
here on a footing of familiarity with the good company except
my Lord Holderness, who had a good stock of acquaintance to
begin with, speaks the language like a native, has very
insinuating manners, was presented under the character of an
old secretary of state, and spent, as is said, £10,000 this
winter, to obtain that object of vanity. Him, indeed, I met
every where in the best company: but as to others&mdash;lords,
earls, marquises, and dukes&mdash;they went about to plays, operas,
and &mdash;&mdash;. Nobody minded them; they kept company with <!-- Page 195 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_195" id="Page_v2_195">[195]</a></span>one
another; and it would have been ridiculous to think of
bringing them into French company. I may add General Clarke,
who was liked and esteemed by several people of merit, which
he owed to his great cleverness and ingenuity, and to his
surprising courage in introducing himself. I enter into this
detail with you, that people with whom I am much more
connected than with the L. family, may not, at any time, be
surprised that I am able to do so little for them in this way,
and may not form false ideas of the hospitality of the French
nation. But I fancy there will not arrive at Paris many people
who will have great claims of past civilities to plead with
me.</p>

<p>"What you tell me of John Adams gives me great consolation. I
had heard of the alarming news of his connexions with
Fairholm, and things were put in the worst light. I was just
ready to write to Ferguson to get from him a just state of the
case; but if he has £15,000, or £18,000 remaining, his
industry will recover him, and he may go on in his usual way
of beneficence and generosity. That family is one of the few
to whose civilities I have been much beholden, and I retain a
lively sense of them.</p>

<p>"Our friend, I mean your friend, Lord Kames, had much provoked
Voltaire, who never forgives, and never thinks any enemy below
his notice. He has accordingly sent to the <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Gazette
Literaire</cite> , an article with regard to the 'Elements of
Criticism,' which turns that book extremely into ridicule,
with a good deal of wit.<a name="FNanchor_195:1_166" id="FNanchor_195:1_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_195:1_166" class="fnanchor">[195:1]</a> I tried to have it suppressed
before it was printed; but the authors of that Gazette told
me, that they durst neither suppress nor alter any thing that
came from Voltaire. I suppose his lordship <!-- Page 196 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_196" id="Page_v2_196">[196]</a></span>holds that satiric
wit as cheap, as he does all the rest of the human race; and
will not be in the least mortified by his censure.</p>

<p>"The taste for literature is neither decayed nor depraved
here, as with the barbarians who inhabit the banks of the
Thames. Some people, who had read your dissertation, affirmed
to me, that it was the finest piece of criticism,
incomparably, to be found in the English tongue. I know not if
you have read the '<cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Poetique de Marmontel</cite>:' it is worth your
perusal. Voltaire has published an edition of Corneille, and
his notes and dissertations contain many fine things. There is
a book published in Holland, in two volumes octavo, called 'De
la Nature.' It is prolix, and in many parts whimsical; but
contains some of the boldest reasonings to be found in print.
There is a miscellany in three volumes duodecimo published
here, where there are many good pieces. It is perhaps more
amusing to me, than it will be to you; as there is scarce a
poem in it whose author I do not know, or the person to whom
it is addressed.</p>

<p>"It is very silly to form distant schemes: but I am fixed at
Paris for some time, and, to judge by probabilities, for life.
My income would suffice me to live at ease, and a younger
brother of the best family would not think himself ill
provided for, if he had such a revenue. Lodgings, a coach, and
clothes, are all I need; and though I have entered late into
this scene of life, I am almost as much at my ease, as if I
had been educated in it from my infancy. However, sickness, or
the infirmities of age, which I may soon expect, may probably
make me think of a retreat: But whether that will be better
found in Paris or elsewhere, time must determine. I forbid
myself all resolution on that head.</p>

<p><!-- Page 197 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_197" id="Page_v2_197">[197]</a></span>"I shall indulge myself in a folly, which I hope you will make
a discreet use of: it is the telling you of an incident which
may appear silly, but which gave more pleasure than perhaps
any other I had ever met with. I was carried, about six weeks
ago, to a masquerade, by Lord Hertford. We went both unmasked;
and we had scarce entered the room when a lady, in mask, came
up to me and exclaimed:&mdash;'<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ha! Monsr. Hume, vous faites bien
de venir ici a visage découvert. Que vous serez bien comblé ce
soir d'honnêtetés et de politesses! Vous verrez, par des
preuves peu équivoques, jusqu'à quel point vous êtes chéri en
France.</i>' This prologue was not a little encouraging; but, as
we advanced through the hall, it is difficult to imagine the
caresses, civilities, and panegyrics which poured on me from
all sides. You would have thought that every one had taken
advantage of his mask to speak his mind with impunity. I could
observe that the ladies were rather the most liberal on this
occasion. But what gave me chief pleasure was to find that
most of the eulogiums bestowed on me, turned on my personal
character, my <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">naïvéte</span>, and simplicity of manners, the candour
and mildness of my disposition, &amp;c.&mdash;<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Non sunt mihi cornea
fibra.</i> I shall not deny that my heart felt a sensible
satisfaction from this general effusion of good will; and Lord
Hertford was much pleased, and even surprised, though he said,
he thought that he had known before upon what footing I stood
with the good company of Paris.</p>

<p>"I allow you to communicate this story to Dr. Jardine. I hope
it will refute all his idle notions that I have no turn for
gallantry and gaiety,<a name="FNanchor_197:1_167" id="FNanchor_197:1_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_197:1_167" class="fnanchor">[197:1]</a>&mdash;that I am on a bad footing with
the ladies,&mdash;that my turn <!-- Page 198 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_198" id="Page_v2_198">[198]</a></span>of conversation can never be
agreeable to them,&mdash;that I never can have any pretensions to
their favours, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. A man in vogue will always have
something to pretend to with the fair sex.</p>

<p>"Do you not think it happy for me to retain such a taste for
idleness and follies at my years; especially since I have come
into a country where the follies are so much more agreeable
than elsewhere? I could only wish that some of my old friends
were to participate with me of these amusements; though I know
none of them that can, on occasion, be so thoroughly idle as
myself.</p>

<p>"I am persuaded you will find great comfort in my house,
which, in every respect, is agreeable. I beg of you and Mrs.
Blair, (to whom I desire my compliments,) that you would
sometimes pay some attention to my sister, who is the person
that suffers most by my absence. I am, dear sir, yours very
sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_198:1_168" id="FNanchor_198:1_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_198:1_168" class="fnanchor">[198:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Blair writes, on the 15th November, assuring Hume that he is fully
conscious of the unreasonableness of expecting him to introduce those
who are accredited to him, to the good company of Paris. He says, that
his own friend expressed himself as "very well satisfied" with Hume's
behaviour towards him; and perhaps he had a better reception than the
letter to Blair might seem to indicate. At all events, Blair seems not
to have been discouraged, for he immediately introduced the son of the
provost of Glasgow, travelling for his health, and Arthur Masson, a
teacher of languages, recommending them to such good offices as Hume
finds himself at liberty to bestow <!-- Page 199 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_199" id="Page_v2_199">[199]</a></span>on them. It is clear, in short, that
he had not been successful in frightening his friends from requesting
him to perform offices of kindness and courtesy, or from trusting that
he would perform them. The following passage, in Blair's letter, is
evidence of the popularity of the Literary classes of the university of
Edinburgh, during the middle of last century.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>My class was, last season, in such reputation that I gave a
second course in summer, at the desire of a body of the
medical students. I am just about to open for this
winter&mdash;with what success I cannot tell; for I tremble for it
every season. Against next season I intend to print a synopsis
of my lectures. In the medical school, a revolution is at a
crisis, which is important to us. Dr. Rutherford wants to
demit in favour of Frank Hume; a measure pushed by Lord
Milton, Baron Mure, and John Home; the coalition of three
formidable powers: but which we college people dread as boding
us no good; and are much more inclined to another scheme, of
placing Cullen in Rutherford's chair, and bringing Dr. Black,
from Glasgow, into the chair of chemistry, which would greatly
promote the reputation of our college, and which has all the
popularity on its side at present.</p>

<p>How unimportant these things seem to you now? I hear much,
from time to time, of your continuing, nay, increasing
celebrity and fame. You are just the high mode, they tell
us&mdash;the very delice of all the good company at Paris.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>In a letter to Millar, chiefly in reference to some English law books,
which Hume had engaged to obtain for a French lawyer, he recurs to the
Memoirs of King James. He seems to have indolently adopted the notion
that there were few chances of his having an opportunity of making
additions to his History of the Stuarts. He did live, however, to see
more than one new edition of it: but the references in them to the
treasure he had discovered at Paris, are extremely meagre. <!-- Page 200 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_200" id="Page_v2_200">[200]</a></span>Another
letter immediately follows, in which we find that his anticipations of
new editions are already outrun by the demands: and we find in his, as
in many other cases, where permanent fame has been reached, that the
excitement of expectant authorship has declined long before its visions
are realized; and that their fulfilment comes at last on minds sobered
down to indifference.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 18th March, 1764.</p>

<p>"I have lived such a life of dissipation as not to be able to
think of any serious occupation. But I begin to tire of that
course of life. I have, however, run over King James's
Memoirs, and have picked up some curious passages, which it is
needless to speak of till we have occasion for a new edition,
which I suppose is very distant."</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 18th April, 1764.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;All the discoveries I made in King James's
Memoirs, make against himself and his brother; and he is
surely a good enough witness on that side: but I believe him
also a man of veracity, and I should have put trust in any
matter of fact that he told from his own knowledge. But this
it is needless for us to talk any more about; since, I
suppose, you have got copies enough of my History, already
printed, to last for your lifetime and mine. I shall certainly
never think of adding another line to it. I am too much your
friend to think of it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I beg my sincere compliments to
Mrs. Millar. I saw a few days ago Mrs. Mallet, who seems to be
going upon a strange project, of living alone, in a hermitage,
in the midst of the forest of Fontainbleau. I pass my <!-- Page 201 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_201" id="Page_v2_201">[201]</a></span>time
very agreeably here; though somewhat too much dissipated for
one of my years and humour."<a name="FNanchor_201:1_169" id="FNanchor_201:1_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_201:1_169" class="fnanchor">[201:1]</a>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 23d April, 1764.</p>

<p>"I was very much surprised with what you tell me, that you had
made a new edition in quarto, of my History of the Tudors, and
might probably do the same with that of the Stuarts. I
imagined that the octavo edition would for a long time
supersede the necessity of any quarto edition; and I wonder
that of the ancient history did not first become requisite.
You were in the wrong to make any edition without informing
me; because I left in Scotland a copy very fully corrected,
with a few alterations, which ought to have been followed. I
shall write to my sister to send it you, and I desire you may
follow it in all future editions, if there be any such. I
shall send you from here the alterations, which my perusal of
King James's Memoirs has occasioned; they are not many, but
some of them, one in particular, is of importance. I have some
scruple of inserting it, on your account, till the sale of the
other editions be pretty considerably advanced. You have not
yet informed me how many you may have upon hand. I suppose a
very considerable number. Father Gordon of the Scots College,
who has an exact memory of King James's Memoirs, was so kind
as to peruse anew my History during the Commonwealth, and the
reigns of the two brothers; and he marked all the passages of
fact, where they differed from the Memoirs. They were
surprisingly few; which gave me some satisfaction; because as
I told you, I take that prince's authority for a plain fact to
be very good.</p>

<p><!-- Page 202 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_202" id="Page_v2_202">[202]</a></span>"I never see Mr. Wilkes here but at chapel, where he is a most
regular, and devout, and edifying, and pious attendant; I take
him to be entirely regenerate. He told me last Sunday, that
you had given him a copy of my Dissertations, with the two
which I had suppressed;<a name="FNanchor_202:1_170" id="FNanchor_202:1_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:1_170" class="fnanchor">[202:1]</a> and that he, foreseeing danger,
from the sale of his library, had wrote to you to find out
that copy, and to tear out the two obnoxious dissertations.
Pray how stands that fact? It was imprudent in you to intrust
him with that copy: it was very prudent in him to use that
precaution. Yet I do not naturally suspect you of imprudence,
nor him of prudence. I must hear a little farther before I
pronounce."<a name="FNanchor_202:2_171" id="FNanchor_202:2_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_202:2_171" class="fnanchor">[202:2]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Millar, writing on 5th June, gives the following account of his conduct
as to the suppressed dissertations.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>"I take Mr. Wilkes to be the same man he was,&mdash;acting a part.
He has forgot the story of the <em>two</em> dissertations. The fact
is, upon importunity, I lent to him the only copy I preserved,
and for years never could recollect he had it, till his books
came to be sold; upon this I went immediately to the gentleman
that directed the sale, told him the fact, and reclaimed the
two dissertations which were my property. Mr. Coates, who was
the person, immediately delivered me the volume; and so soon
as I got home, I tore them out and burnt them, that I might
not lend them to any for the future. Two days after, Mr.
Coates sent me a note for the volume, as Mr. Wilkes had
desired it should be sent to him to Paris; I returned the
volume, but told him the two dissertations, I had torn out of
the volume and burnt, being my property. This is the truth of
the matter, and nothing but the truth. It was certainly
imprudent for me to lend them to him."</p>

fellow-countrymen, in the Douglas cause, has already been noticed. As
the inquiry which had taken place in France had not been long concluded,
and was the object of discussion in the Court of Session, the adherents
of the exiled royal house, and other Scottish families residing in
Paris, naturally took such a deep interest in the proceedings, as the
following letter explains.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Baron Mure</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 22d June, 1764.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;A few days ago I dined with the Duchess of
Perth, which was the first time I had seen that venerable old
lady, who is really a very sensible woman. Part of our
conversation was upon the Douglas affair.</p>

<p>"That lady, as well as all the company, as well as every body
of common sense here, shows her entire conviction of that
imposture; and there was present a gentleman, an old friend of
yours, a person of very good understanding and of undoubted
honour, who laid open to us a scene of such deliberate
dishonesty on the part of her grace of Douglas and her
partisans, as was somewhat new and surprising. I suppose it is
all known to poor Andrew,<a name="FNanchor_203:1_172" id="FNanchor_203:1_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_203:1_172" class="fnanchor">[203:1]</a> whom I heartily love and
pity. 'Tis certain, that the imposture is as well known to her
grace and her friends, as to any body; and Hay, the
Pretender's old secretary, the only man of common honesty
among them, confessed to this gentleman, that he has
frequently been shocked with their practices, and has run away
from them to keep <!-- Page 204 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_204" id="Page_v2_204">[204]</a></span>out of the way of such infamy; though he
had afterwards the weakness to yield to their solicitations.
Carnegy knows the roguery as well as the rest; though I did
not hear any thing of his scruples. Lord Beauchamp and Dr.
Trail, our chaplain, passed four months last summer at Rheims,
where this affair was much the subject of conversation. Except
one curate, they did not meet with a person, that was not
convinced of the imposture. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons. de Puysieuls</span>,<a name="FNanchor_204:1_173" id="FNanchor_204:1_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_204:1_173" class="fnanchor">[204:1]</a> whose
country seat is in the neighbourhood, told me the same thing.
Can any thing be more scandalous and more extraordinary than
Frank Garden's behaviour?<a name="FNanchor_204:2_174" id="FNanchor_204:2_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_204:2_174" class="fnanchor">[204:2]</a> Can any thing be more
scandalous and more ordinary than Burnet's. I am afraid, that
notwithstanding the palpable justice of your cause, it is yet
uncertain whether you will prevail.</p>

<p>"I continue to live here in a manner amusing enough, and which
gives me no time to be tired of any scene. What between public
business, the company of the learned and that of the great,
especially of the ladies, I find all my time filled up, and
have no time to open a book, except it be some books newly
published, which may be the subject of conversation. I am well
enough pleased with this change of life, and a satiety of
study had beforehand prepared the way for it: however, time
runs off in one course of life as well as another, and all
things appear so much alike, that I am afraid of falling into
total Stoicism and indifference about every thing. For
instance, I am every moment to be touching on the time when I
am to receive my credential letters of secretary to the
embassy, with a <!-- Page 205 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_205" id="Page_v2_205">[205]</a></span>thousand a-year of appointments. The king has
promised it, all the members have promised it; Lord Hertford
earnestly solicits it; the plainest common sense and justice
seem to require [it]: yet have I been in this condition above
six months; and I never trouble my head about the matter, and
have rather laid my account that there is to be no such thing.</p>

<p>"Please to express my most profound respects to Mrs. Mure, and
my sense of the honour she did me. If I have leisure before
the carrier goes off, I shall write her, and give her some
account of my adventures; but I would not show her so little
mark of my attention as to write her only in a postscript. I
am, dear Baron," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_205:1_175" id="FNanchor_205:1_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_205:1_175" class="fnanchor">[205:1]</a></p>

<p>The correspondence with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span> was occasionally resumed,
when Hume or she was absent from Paris. How well the philosopher could
upon occasion accommodate himself to the taste of a French lady of the
court, the following may suffice to show.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Compiegne, 6th July, 1764.</p>

<p>We live in a kind of solitude and retirement at Compiegne; at
least I do, who, having nothing but a few general acquaintance
at court, and not caring to make more, have given myself up
almost entirely to study and retreat. You cannot imagine,
madam, with what pleasure I return as it were to my natural
element, and what satisfaction I enjoy in reading, and musing,
and sauntering, amid the agreeable scenes that surround me.
But yes, you can easily enough imagine it; you have yourself
formed the same resolution; you are determined this summer to
tie the broken thread of your studies and literary amusements.
If you have been so happy as to execute your purpose, you are
almost in the <!-- Page 206 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_206" id="Page_v2_206">[206]</a></span>same state as myself, and are at present
wandering along the banks of the same beautiful river, perhaps
with the same books in your hand, a Racine, I suppose, or a
Virgil, and despise all other pleasure and amusement. Alas!
why am I not so near you, that I could see you for half an
hour a day, and confer with you on these subjects?</p>

<p>But this ejaculation, methinks, does not lead me directly in
my purposed road, of forgetting you. It is a short digression,
which is soon over: and that I may return to the right path, I
shall give you some account of the state of the court; I mean
the exterior face of it; for I know no more; and if I did, I
am become so great a politician, that nothing should make me
reveal it. The king divides his evenings every week after the
following manner: one he gives to the public, when he sups at
the grand convent;<a name="FNanchor_206:1_176" id="FNanchor_206:1_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_206:1_176" class="fnanchor">[206:1]</a> two he passes with his own family;
two in a society of men; and, to make himself amends, two he
passes with ladies, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Grammont</span>, usually, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de
Mirepoix</span>, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Beauveau</span>. This last princess passed
three evenings in this manner at the Hermitage immediately
before her departure, which was on Monday last. I think her
absence a great loss to that society; I am so presumptuous as
to think it one to myself. I found her as obliging and as
friendly as if she had never conversed with kings, and never
were a politician. I really doubt much of her talent for
politics. Pray what is your opinion? Is she qualified,
otherwise than by having great sense and an agreeable
conversation, to make progress in the road to favour? and are
not these qualities rather an encumbrance to her? I have met
her once or twice, with another lady, in whose favour I am
much prepossessed; she seems agreeable, well behaved,
judicious, a great reader; speaks as if she had sentiment, and
was superior to the vulgar train of amusements. I should have
been willing, notwithstanding my present love of solitude, to
have cultivated an acquaintance with her, but she did not say
any thing so obliging to me as to give me encouragement. Would
you conjecture that I mean the Countess of Tessé? I know not
whether you are acquainted with that lady. But I shall <!-- Page 207 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_207" id="Page_v2_207">[207]</a></span>never
have done with this idle train of conversation; and therefore,
to cut things short, I kiss your hands most humbly and
devoutly, and bid you adieu.<a name="FNanchor_207:1_177" id="FNanchor_207:1_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_207:1_177" class="fnanchor">[207:1]</a></p>

the ground of his blindness; and a bitter litigation ensued in the

vital in a religious view, persecuted him with all the savage and
relentless cruelty of fanaticism. "No liberal and cultivated mind," he
says, in reference to this dispute, "can entertain the least hesitation

is given:</p>

<div class="bqfn">
<p class="center">(<i>Translation.</i>)</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 16th May, 1759.</p>

<p>"I pass my time, both in town and country, in a circle of
gentlemen, of whom some are acquainted with English, others
not. They had been highly pleased with some portions of your
works, which had been translated; and among others with your
'Political Discourses,' where they found the practical views
of a citizen, united with the profound reflections of a
politician, and the perspicacity of a philosopher. To put the
whole circle in a position to judge for themselves of the
merit of these works, I undertook, in the course of a country
jaunt which we took all together, to translate your 'Natural
History of Religion.' I chose this piece because it appeared
to me to contain a complete exposition of philosophy on this
subject. I was well rewarded for my pains, by the pleasure I
found I gave to all the world. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Dupré de St. Maur</span>, who
has honoured me with the kindest friendship from my infancy,
told me she wished much that you were made acquainted with
this feeble effort. M. Steward, whom I met with M. Helvetius,
and who wished much to hear the perusal, promised to send it
to you."</p>
</div>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Dupré de St. Maur</span> writes, on 16th May, 1759, that Montigny had
received Hume's acknowledgment, which produced more effect on him than
any piece of good fortune he had hitherto experienced. "I partook," she
says, "of his joy the more sensibly, as I had in a great measure
inspired him with confidence to send you his translation, in the
persuasion that great men are the most indulgent."&mdash;MS. R.S.E.</p>

<p>We find the tone of this letter frequently responded to in the
correspondence of Grimm with his German patrons, though the Baron does
not always coincide in the praises he has to record. Andrew Stuart,
known by his letters to Lord Mansfield, who before 1763 was much
employed in France in connexion with the Douglas cause, and appears to
have been admitted into the best company there, writes to Sir William
Johnstone on 16th December, 1762: "When you have occasion to see our
friend, David Hume, tell him that he is so much worshipped here, that he
must be void of all passions, if he does not immediately take post for
Paris. In most houses where I am acquainted here, one of the first
questions is, Do you know Mons<sup>r</sup>. Hume, whom we all admire so much? I
dined yesterday at Helvetius's, where this same Mons<sup>r</sup>. Hume
interrupted our conversation very much."&mdash;(MS. R.S.E.)</p>

<p>The following note, from the impetuous Alexander Murray, responds to the
same strain:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqfn">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Hume</span>,&mdash;The great desire that several French gentlemen

I have promised to procure them, makes me ardently beg the

rencounters with the men, my dear friend, give me no sort of

you will acquit yourself with the fair sex, whose impatience
of knowing you is not to be expressed. The day you dine with
me you will meet some folks who admire your productions as
much as any of your own countrymen, and perhaps comprehend
your sublime ideas as well as they do. I beg leave to assure
you that no body loves and admires you more than your most

considered disrespectful. The first-named was the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Berri</span>,

Hume has underrated his age, which was six; he was born in 1757. Thus
were these children, who made their little speeches to the historian of
Charles I., all destined to be, successively, kings of France, and to
experience a too intimate acquaintance with such scenes as they found
depicted in his "fine history!"</p>

It is said that an attempt was made to convey them to St. Omers; but
having to be committed, for some time, to the care of a Frenchman, his
wife became alarmed lest the regal emblems on the binding might expose
the family to danger from the Terrorists. The narrative proceeds to say,
that she first cut off the binding and buried the manuscripts, but that
being still haunted by fears, she exhumed and burned them. See the
introduction by Dr. Staniers Clarke, to "The Life of James II." believed
to be an abridgment of these manuscripts. Hume is not consistent as to
the number of volumes.</p>

</div>

<p class="section">There were many things to make the social position he obtained in France
infinitely gratifying to Hume. Even his good birth was no claim to
admission on a position of liberal familiarity with the higher
aristocracy of England. His descent from a line of Scottish lairds would
be insufficient in the eyes of the Walpoles, Russels, and Seymours, to
distinguish him from the common herd of men who could put on a laced
waistcoat and powdered wig, and command decent treatment from the
lackeys in their ante-chambers. His claims rested on his Literary rank;
and the extent to which such claims might be admitted was fixed by
Hereditary rank at its own discretion. It might cordially receive them
one day, and repel them with cold disdain on another. In this doubtful
<!-- Page 208 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_208" id="Page_v2_208">[208]</a></span>and partial recognition, Hume would find himself in the motley crowd of
those who force themselves, or are partly welcomed, into these high
places&mdash;dissipated men of genius, underbred men of riches, hardworking,
pertinacious politicians; persons with whom his finely trained mind, his
reserve, and his habit of mixing in a refined though small society of
Scotsmen, would not easily harmonize.</p>

<p>In France matters were widely different; there he was at once warmly and
affectionately received into the bosom of a society to which many of the
supercilious English aristocracy would have sought for admission in
vain. In England no distinct palpable barrier surrounded the
distinguished group. The multitude clamorously asserted an equality. In
default of other qualities, impudence and perseverance were sometimes
sufficient to force admission. In these circumstances, each member of
the privileged classes guarded his own portion of the arena as well as
he might, and the intruder had to fight battle after battle, and contest
every inch of ground he gained.</p>

<p>It seems as if in France the very rigidness with which the select circle
was fortified was the reason why those admitted within it were placed so
thoroughly at their ease. The aristocracy could open the door, look
about them, and invite an individual to enter, without fearing to
encounter a general rush for admission. There was much evil of every
kind in that circle; we have not to deal here with its inward morality,
but its outward form, and it certainly deserves to be remembered as one
of the most memorable instances in which, on any large scale, the
aristocracy of rank and wealth has met the aristocracy of letters
without restraint. The quality of shining in conversation was not to be
despised by the greatest in wealth, or the highest in <!-- Page 209 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_209" id="Page_v2_209">[209]</a></span>the peerage; and
their efforts were measured with those of the first wits of the time. To
an aristocracy which could thus amuse itself, it was a great luxury to
be surrounded by men of thought and learning. The courtier who could
open his salon to the wits and philosophers of Paris, was far more
dependant on their presence than they were on the privilege of
admission. If a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Barthélemi</span>, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marmontel</span>, a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Condillac</span>, saw cause to
desert the suppers of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Holbach</span>, they would be received at those of the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Praslin</span> or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de Choiseul</span>, the Prince of Conti, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame du
Deffand</span>; but how were such departed stars to be replaced?<a name="FNanchor_209:1_178" id="FNanchor_209:1_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_209:1_178" class="fnanchor">[209:1]</a></p>

<p>There is perhaps no more striking type of the <!-- Page 210 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_210" id="Page_v2_210">[210]</a></span>character and condition
of the Parisian coteries than one of Hume's most intimate friends,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin</span>. In this country, were an uneducated woman to frame and
lead a social party, including the first in rank and in talent of the
day, to which no one under royalty was too great not to deem admission a
privilege; were she to be absolute in her admissions and exclusions,
bold in her sarcasms, free and blunt often to rudeness in her
observations and opinions, and severe or kind to all by turns as her own
choice or caprice suggested, it would be at once pronounced that the
reddest blood and the highest rank could alone produce such an anomaly.
A very small number of eminent duchesses have perhaps occupied such a
position in this country. Yet <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin</span>, who acted this part to
the full among the fastidious aristocracy of France before the
revolution, was the daughter of a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">valet-de-chambre</span> and the widow of a
glass manufacturer. The foundation of her influence was her success in
making herself the centre of a circle of artists and men of letters. She
was much in the confidence of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame De Tencin</span>, and on that lady's death
succeeded in transferring to herself what remained of her distinguished
society, dimmed as it was by the departure of Montesquieu and
Fontenelle. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin</span> by activity and energy widened the circle.
She never made visits herself, and those who had the privilege of
entering her dining-room on her public days, found there assembled
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert, Helvétius, Raynal, Marmontel, Caraccioli, Holbach, Galliani</span>,
and the artist Vanloo. During the British embassy, David Hume, the great
philosopher from the far North, might there be met; and when all other
attempts had perhaps failed, some chance of encountering such an erratic
meteor as Rousseau <!-- Page 211 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_211" id="Page_v2_211">[211]</a></span>still remained in attending <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin's</span>
Wednesday dinner. Having once, by her signal wit and wisdom, gained her
position, no obtrusive rivals from her own deserted class could push
near enough to drive her from it. It is not the least admirable feature
of this remarkable woman, that far from assuming the subdued and
cautious tone of one of her own rank, who must be more wary than a
denizen of committing breaches of the social rules of her new cast, a
simplicity and freedom seems to have accompanied all her actions and
ideas; a courageous adoption of what seemed good to her in place of what
might be fit. Her letters, in their severe diction, give some notion of
the writer's character, but cannot convey so full an impression as when
they are presented in the bold, irregular, and most "unlady-like" hand
in which they are scribbled.<a name="FNanchor_211:1_179" id="FNanchor_211:1_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_211:1_179" class="fnanchor">[211:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 212 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_212" id="Page_v2_212">[212]</a></span>The pleasant retailers of the literary chit-chat of that time,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marmontel</span>, Grimm, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bauchemont</span>, and others, are full of details of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame
Geoffrin</span>, who, if she was not quite as formally approached as <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boufflers</span>,
or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Deffand</span>, was as much respected, loved, and feared. The author of the
<cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contes Moraux</cite>," tells us some of the weaknesses of this gifted lady;
and, according to his account, she had been actually convicted, living
as she was outwardly in the freest society in the world, of a turn for
secret devotion! "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle avait un apartement dans un couvent de
religieuses et une tribune à l'Eglise des Capucins,&mdash;mais avec autant de
mystère que les femmes galantes de ce temps-là avaient des petites
maisons.</span>" The picture would be sufficiently ludicrous, were it not for
the darker features presented by a state of society, where no one should
venture to be pious except under pain of being exterminated with
ridicule.</p>

<p>There was one matter as to which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin</span> was timid and cautious;
she never meddled with matters of state or unsafe political opinions,
and was induced to discountenance those who did so. Surrounded by
restless and inquiring spirits, she often dreaded being compromised by
their conduct; and was especially uneasy at any time when the Bastille
sheltered a more than usual number of those whose wit was wont to flash
round her board. But her guests have recorded, that if there was a
little saddened and earnest gravity in her deportment, when she received
them after such naughty affairs, she abated nothing of her old kindness.
Her good heart indeed was after all her noblest quality. She was one of
those who held the simple notion, that were it not for the judicious
distribution <!-- Page 213 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_213" id="Page_v2_213">[213]</a></span>of favours by the rich, the poor, including artisans and
producers of all kinds, must necessarily die of starvation. She was thus
in the midst of an extensive distribution of charities, actively
occupied in the <em>encouragement</em> of those who lived by the sweat of their
brow; and if she believed that she accomplished much more than she
actually did, it was a satisfaction not to be grudged to one who
occupied herself with the fortunes of the poor, in the midst of the
stony indifference of the French aristocracy of that day.</p>

<p>Another lady, a friend and correspondent of Hume, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame le Page du
Boccage</span>, endeavoured to rival <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin</span> as a centre of attraction;
but though she possessed, along with wealth, both rank and beauty, she
was unsuccessful, on account of the presence of a third
quality&mdash;authorship. The wits must praise her bad poetry if they
frequented her house, and where so many other doors were open without
such a condition, they abandoned it. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle était d'une figure aimable,"
says Grimm, "elle est bonne femme; elle est riche; elle pouvait fixer
chez elle les gens d'esprit et de bonne compagnie, sans les mettre dans
l'embarras de lui parler avec peu de sincérité de sa <em>Colombiade</em>  ou de
ses <em>Amazones</em>.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_213:1_180" id="FNanchor_213:1_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_213:1_180" class="fnanchor">[213:1]</a></p>

<p>Perhaps of all these eminent women, while <!-- Page 214 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_214" id="Page_v2_214">[214]</a></span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span> had the
greatest amount of elegance and accomplishment, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame du Deffand</span> had
the sharpest and most searching wit. She was the author of that
proverbial <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bon mot</i> about St. Denis carrying his head under his arm,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">il n'y a que le premier pas qui coûte</i>; a saying sufficient to make a
reputation in France. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame du Deffand</span> does not appear to have been a
correspondent of Hume, nor, though they occasionally met, does much
cordiality seem to have subsisted between them.<a name="FNanchor_214:1_181" id="FNanchor_214:1_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_214:1_181" class="fnanchor">[214:1]</a> The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">aveugle
clairvoyante</span>, as Voltaire aptly called her, in allusion to her blindness
and her wit, thought that she discovered in Hume a worshipper at another
shrine. She wrote to Walpole expressing her disgust of those who paid
court to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>, at the same time, only just not stating,
in express terms, how much they were mistaken in not transferring their
obsequiousness to herself.<a name="FNanchor_214:2_182" id="FNanchor_214:2_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_214:2_182" class="fnanchor">[214:2]</a> She, certainly an object <!-- Page 215 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_215" id="Page_v2_215">[215]</a></span>of pity from
her blindness, was still more so in her own discontented spirit. The
days which tranquil ease and the attentions of kind friends might have
soothed, were disturbed by restless vanity, an intense desire to
interfere with the doings of that world which she could not see,
dissipation, and literary wrangles.</p>

<p>One remarkable person, an offshoot of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame du Deffand's</span> circle, and
driven forth from it to raise an empire of her own, was <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle de
L'Espinasse</span>. Hume and she met frequently in Paris, and they subsequently
corresponded together. She was an illegitimate child, who, having been
well educated, had been adopted by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame du Deffand</span> as her companion,
and the minister for supplying, as far as possible, her lost sense of
sight. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle</span> had to be present at those displays of intellect
which illuminated the table of her mistress. It soon began to transpire
that the humble drudge possessed a soul of fire; and taking part in the
conversation, her remarks rose as she acquired confidence and ease, into
an originality of thought, fulness of judgment, and rich eloquence of
language, which fascinated the senses of those veteran champions in the
arena of intellect. Thus many of those who went to offer their incense
to a woman old and blind, were constrained to bestow some of it on one
"young in years, but in sage counsel old," who had little more outward
claim on their admiration; for <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle de L'Espinasse</span> was naturally
plain, and was deeply marked with smallpox. The patroness did not
present herself till six o'clock in the evening; to her who knew no
difference between light and darkness it was morning. She often found
that her <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégée</span> had been entertaining the guests for an hour, and that
they had come early to enjoy her conversation. This was treason&mdash;an
<!-- Page 216 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_216" id="Page_v2_216">[216]</a></span>overt tampering with the allegiance of the followers; and the
subordinate was driven forth with contumely.</p>

<p>It is not easy to decide which party, if either, was in the right;
though the memoir writers in general take the part of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle de
L'Espinasse</span>. Far from being made a homeless wanderer by the dismissal,
she was immediately supplied with a house and furniture by her friends,
who obtained for her a pension from the crown. On these means she
founded a rival establishment of her own; and surrounded herself with an
intellectual circle, which seems to have more than rivalled in
brilliancy that from which she was dismissed. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> was told that
if he countenanced the new idol, he must bid farewell to his former
patroness. He at once joined the party of the young aspirant. He became
dangerously ill, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle de L'Espinasse</span> nursed him with the
untiring affection of a wife or a daughter. The philosopher, whose
humble dwelling was found to be on too sordid a scale to be consistent
with health, thenceforth took up his abode with his young friend. Hume
must have witnessed the rise of this new connexion, for it was during
his residence in Paris that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert's</span> illness took place, and it is
the object of occasional anxious allusion by his Parisian
acquaintance.<a name="FNanchor_216:1_183" id="FNanchor_216:1_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_216:1_183" class="fnanchor">[216:1]</a></p>

<p>Though the circumstances in which he passed his <!-- Page 217 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_217" id="Page_v2_217">[217]</a></span>earlier days were not
likely to nourish such a taste, no man seems to have been more dependant
on the presence of an educated and intellectual female than the
secretary of the Academy. There is little doubt that the new attachment
was of a Platonic character; but it boded evil to both parties. The
lady, if she had some portion of the purer affections of the soul to
bestow upon the sage, had <!-- Page 218 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_218" id="Page_v2_218">[218]</a></span>warmer feelings for likelier objects; and her
frame sunk before the consuming fires of more than one passion.<a name="FNanchor_218:1_184" id="FNanchor_218:1_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_218:1_184" class="fnanchor">[218:1]</a>
She was carried to an early grave, and the mortifications, caused by her
alienation, followed by grief for her death, broke the spirit, and
imbittered and enfeebled the latter days of the philosopher. Hume seems
to have established a closer friendship with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> than with any of
his other contemporaries in France; and he left a memorial of his regard
for <!-- Page 219 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_219" id="Page_v2_219">[219]</a></span>the encyclopediast in his will. Unlike, in many respects, they had
some features in common. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert's</span> personal character, and the habits
of his life, had, like his philosophy, the dignity of simplicity. His
figure, and still more his voice, were the objects of much malicious
sarcasm; but cruel jests could not make his fragile body less the
tenement of a noble spirit; or his shrill puny voice less the instrument
of great and bold thoughts. His mind stands forth in strong relief from
the frippery of that age; while his writings contain no marks of that
reckless infidelity which distinguishes the productions of his fellow
labourers. In some of those follies, so prevalent that a man utterly
free of them, must have courted the charge of eccentricity, if not of
insanity, he partook; but moderately and reluctantly, as one suited for
a better time and a nobler sphere of exertion. In the quarrel with
Rousseau, he adopted the cause of Hume with honest zeal. He wrote many
letters to Hume, which are still preserved. They perhaps, in some
measure, exhibit the least amiable feature of his character&mdash;his
bitterness, it might be almost termed hatred, towards <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame du Deffand</span>,
on account of her conduct to his own friend.</p>

<p>It is unnecessary to discourse, at any length, on the distinguished
men&mdash;including the names of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Buffon, Malesherbes, Diderot, Crébillon,
Morellet, Helvétius, Holbach, Hénault, Raynal, Suard, La Condamine</span>, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Brosses</span>, who courted Hume's company in France. Next to D'Alembert,
his closest friendship seems to have been with the honest and thoughtful
statesman, Turgot; who, in the midst of that reckless whirl of vanity,
was already looking far into the future, and predicting, from the
disorganized and menacing condition of the elements of French society,
<!-- Page 220 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_220" id="Page_v2_220">[220]</a></span>the storm that was to come. He wrote many letters to Hume, containing
remarks on matters of statesmanship and political economy, which are of
great interest in a historical and economical view, especially in one
instance, where he notices the want of any common principle of
sympathies and interests connecting the aristocracy with the people, and
reflects on the dangerous consequences of such a state of matters to the
peace of Europe.</p>

<p>There are many circumstances showing that much as he loved the social
ease, combined with learning and wit, for which his Parisian circle was
conspicuous, he disliked one prominent feature of that social
system&mdash;the scornful infidelity, the almost intolerance of any thing
like earnest belief, so often exhibited, both in speech and conduct. Sir
Samuel Romilly has preserved the following curious statement by
Diderot:&mdash;"He spoke of his acquaintance with Hume. '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous dirai un
trait de lui, mais il vous sera un peu scandaleux peut-être, car vous
Anglais vous croyez <em>un peu</em> en Dieu; pour nous autres nous n'y croyons
guères. Hume dîna avec une grande compagnie chez le Baron D'Holbach. Il
était assis à côté du Baron; on parla de la religion naturelle: 'Pour
les Athées,' disait Hume, 'je ne crois pas qu'il en existe; je n'en ai
jamais vu.' 'Vous avez été un peu malheureux,' répondit l'autre, 'vous
voici à table avec dix-sept pour la première fois.</span>'"<a name="FNanchor_220:1_185" id="FNanchor_220:1_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_220:1_185" class="fnanchor">[220:1]</a></p>

<p>The secretary's residence in the metropolis was occasionally varied by
official sojourns to Fontainbleau, or <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Compiègne</span>, a visit to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse
de Barbantane</span> at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Villers Cotterets</span>, or an excursion with Madame de
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Boufflers</span> and the Prince of Conti to <!-- Page 221 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_221" id="Page_v2_221">[221]</a></span><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Ile-Adam</span>. That rural seat of
princely magnificence and hospitality is a familiar name in the memoirs
of the times; and particularly in those of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Genlis</span>. It is
singular, indeed, that this lady never mentions Hume, though she appears
to have been living in the castle at the time when he visited it. The
Prince of Conti was in every way possessed of the external
qualifications which, in the eyes of his countrymen, were then the
proper ornaments of his high station. He was brave, a distinguished
military leader, generous, extravagant, gallant, and a lover of
literature and the arts.<a name="FNanchor_221:1_186" id="FNanchor_221:1_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:1_186" class="fnanchor">[221:1]</a> There was probably little in such a
character to rival a Turgot, or a <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> in Hume's esteem; but
his intercourse with this prince, as with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">De Rohan, De Choiseul</span>, and
others, would be of a more limited and formal character.<a name="FNanchor_221:2_187" id="FNanchor_221:2_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_221:2_187" class="fnanchor">[221:2]</a> <!-- Page 222 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_222" id="Page_v2_222">[222]</a></span>His
influence with courtiers and statesmen, however, appears to have been
considerable. In the letters addressed to him there are several
instances where French people solicit his interposition with the great:
thus, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Helvétius</span> desires his good offices to procure an abbaye for
her friend and neighbour the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé "Macdonalt</span>," of an illustrious Irish
family.<a name="FNanchor_222:1_188" id="FNanchor_222:1_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_222:1_188" class="fnanchor">[222:1]</a> One lady, seeking ecclesiastical patronage, tells him
that the clergy will have more pleasure in doing him a favour than in
performing the functions of their office!</p>

<p>Hume has thus recorded in his "own life" the impression left on him by
his reception in Paris:&mdash;"Those who have not seen the strange effects of
modes, will never imagine the reception I met with at Paris, from men
and women of all ranks and stations. The more I resiled from their
excessive civilities, the more I was loaded with them. There is,
however, a real satisfaction in living at Paris; from the great number
of sensible, knowing, and polite company with which that city abounds
above all places in the universe. I thought once of settling there for
life." If he thought that he could have taken up his residence in Paris,
and preserved for the remainder of his days the fresh bloom of his
reputation, he was undoubtedly mistaken; but, dazzled as he in some
measure was, we can see in his correspondence that he estimated the
sensation he made pretty nearly at its just value. In the circle of
toys, seized and discarded, by a giddy fashionable crowd, philosophy
will have its turn, as well as poodles, parrots, tulips, monkeys, cafés,
and black pages. It had been so a century earlier, when the most
abstruse works <!-- Page 223 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_223" id="Page_v2_223">[223]</a></span>of Des Cartes had been the ornament of every fashionable
lady's toilette; and now the wheel had revolved and philosophy was again
in vogue.</p>

<p>A second time we have Lord Charlemont affording us a passing sketch of
Hume. Having had an opportunity of witnessing the philosopher's
reception in France, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>"From what has been already said of him, it is apparent that
his conversation to strangers, and particularly to Frenchmen,
could be little delightful, and still more particularly, one
would suppose, to French women: and yet no lady's toilette was
complete without Hume's attendance. At the opera his broad
unmeaning face was usually seen <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">entre deux jolis minois</i>. The
ladies in France gave the ton, and the ton was deism: a
species of philosophy ill suited to the softer sex, in whose
delicate frame weakness is interesting, and timidity a
charm.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. How my friend Hume was able to endure the
encounter of these French female Titans, I know not. In
England, either his philosophic pride or his conviction that
infidelity was ill suited to women, made him perfectly averse
from the initiation of ladies into the mysteries of his
doctrine."<a name="FNanchor_223:1_189" id="FNanchor_223:1_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:1_189" class="fnanchor">[223:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The same characteristics are recorded by Grimm.<a name="FNanchor_223:2_190" id="FNanchor_223:2_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_223:2_190" class="fnanchor">[223:2]</a> We have his
position still more vividly painted by Madame d'Epinay, according to
whom he must have undergone not a small portion of the martyrdom of
lionism. One of the "rages" of the day was the holding of cafés, or
giving entertainments in private <!-- Page 224 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_224" id="Page_v2_224">[224]</a></span>houses, according to the arrangements
and etiquette of a public café. Among the amusements of the evening were
pantomimes, and acted tableaux. In these it was necessary that Hume
should take a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">rôle</i>, and as he was always willing to conform to
established regulations, we find him seated as a sultan between two
obdurate beauties, intending to strike his bosom, but aiming the blows
at <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">le ventre</i>, and accompanying his acting with characteristic
exclamations.<a name="FNanchor_224:1_191" id="FNanchor_224:1_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_224:1_191" class="fnanchor">[224:1]</a></p>

<p>Hume's popularity in Paris appears to have somewhat disturbed Horace
Walpole's equanimity. He was too good an artist to be very angry, or to
express himself in terms of aggravated bitterness; but it is clear from
<!-- Page 225 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_225" id="Page_v2_225">[225]</a></span>occasional notices, that, notwithstanding his professed admiration of
Scotsmen, it displeased him to find Hume the Scotsman sitting at the
king's gate. Writing to Lady Hervey on 14th Sept. 1765, he says, "Mr.
Hume, that is <em>the mode</em>, asked much about your ladyship."<a name="FNanchor_225:1_192" id="FNanchor_225:1_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:1_192" class="fnanchor">[225:1]</a> Then
to Montague, on the 22d of the same month, and in allusion to the
conversation of the dinner-table in Paris:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>For literature, it is very amusing when one has nothing else
to do. I think it rather pedantic in society: tiresome when
displayed professedly; and, besides, in this country, one is
sure it is only the fashion of the day. Their taste in it is
the worst of all; could one believe, that when they read our
authors, Richardson and Mr. Hume should be their favourites?
The latter is treated here with perfect veneration. His
History, so falsified in many points, so partial in as many,
so very unequal in its parts, is thought the standard of
writing.<a name="FNanchor_225:2_193" id="FNanchor_225:2_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:2_193" class="fnanchor">[225:2]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Thus, and in the like strain, do the French suffer in his good opinion,
for their offence in making an idol of Hume. So, on the 3d October, when
writing to Mr. Chute,&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Their authors, who by the way are every where, are worse than
their own writings, which I don't mean as a compliment to
either. In general, the style of conversation is solemn,
pedantic, and seldom animated, but by a dispute. I was
expressing my aversion to disputes: Mr. Hume, who very
gratefully admires the tone of Paris, having never known any
other tone, said with great surprise, "Why, what do you like,
if you hate both disputes and whisk?"<a name="FNanchor_225:3_194" id="FNanchor_225:3_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_225:3_194" class="fnanchor">[225:3]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, on the 19th of the same month, to Mr. Brand:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I assure you, you may come hither very safely, and be in no
danger from mirth. Laughing is as much out of fashion <!-- Page 226 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_226" id="Page_v2_226">[226]</a></span>as
pantins and bilboquets. Good folks, they have no time to
laugh. There is God and the king to be pulled down first; and
men and women, one and all, are devoutly employed in the
demolition. They think me quite profane for having any belief
left. But this is not my only crime; I have told them, and am
undone by it, that they have taken from us to admire the two
dullest things we had&mdash;Whisk and Richardson. It is very true
that they want nothing but George Grenville to make their
conversations, or rather dissertations, the most tiresome upon
earth. For Lord Lyttelton, if he would come hither, and turn
freethinker once more, he would be reckoned the most agreeable
man in France,&mdash;next to Mr. Hume, who is the only thing in the
world that they believe implicitly, which they must do, for I
defy them to understand any language that he speaks.<a name="FNanchor_226:1_195" id="FNanchor_226:1_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_226:1_195" class="fnanchor">[226:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 227 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_227" id="Page_v2_227">[227]</a></span>At this time Adam Smith was travelling in France, with his pupil, the
young Duke of Buccleuch. On <!-- Page 228 --><span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_v2_228" id="Page_v2_228">[228]</a></span>5th July, 1764, he writes from Toulouse,
requesting Hume to give him and his pupil introductions to distinguished
Frenchmen, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Richelieu</span>, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marquis de Lorges</span>, &amp;c. He says,
that Mr. Townsend had assured him of these and other introductions, from
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Choiseul</span>, but that none had made their appearance in that
quarter. Smith seems to have been heartily tired of the glittering
bondage of his tutorship, and to have sighed for the academic
conviviality he had left behind him at Glasgow. He says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The Duke is acquainted with no Frenchman whatever. I cannot cultivate
the acquaintance of the few with whom I am acquainted, as I cannot bring
them to our house, and am not always at liberty to go to theirs. The
life which I led at Glasgow, was a pleasureable dissipated life in
comparison of that which I lead here at present. I have begun to write a
book, in order to pass away the time. You may believe I have very little
to do. If Sir James would come and spend a month with us in his travels,
it would not only be a great satisfaction to me, but he might, by his
influence and example, be of great service to the Duke."<a name="FNanchor_228:1_196" id="FNanchor_228:1_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_228:1_196" class="fnanchor">[228:1]</a></p>

<p>There is little doubt that the book he had begun to write, was the
"Wealth of Nations:" and we have here probably the earliest announcement
of his employing himself in that work. On the 21st of October, he writes
from Toulouse, stating that the <!-- Page 229 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_229" id="Page_v2_229">[229]</a></span>letters of introduction had reached
him, and that his noble pupil was well received. He says, "Our
expedition to Bourdeaux, and another we have made since to Bagneres, has
made a great change upon the Duke. He begins now to familiarize himself
to French company; and I flatter myself I shall spend the rest of the
time we are to live together, not only in peace and contentment, but in
great amusement."</p>

<p>Amidst the multiplied attractions of Paris, Hume's thoughts were often
turned to his native city, and the circle of kind friends and admirers
he had there left behind him. Such reminiscences of home doings as are
contained in the following letters, would doubtless ensure his warm
attention. On 1st July, Blair writes:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Robertson has, of late, had worse health than usual, which has
somewhat interrupted his studies. He talked once of a trip to
France this season; but his want of the language is so
discouraging, as seems to have made him lay aside thoughts of
it for the present. It will be a twelvemonth more, I suppose,
before his Charles V. shall see the light.</p>

<p>I dined this day with Sir James Macdonald, on whose praises I
need not expatiate to you. Much conversation we had about you;
and a great deal I heard of your flourishing state. You write
concerning it yourself, like a philosopher and a man of sense.
The first splendour and eclat of such situations soon loses
its lustre, and often, as you found it, is burdensome. Ease
and agreeable society are the only things that last and
remain; and these, now that you are quite naturalized, and
have formed habits of life, I imagine you enjoy in a very
comfortable degree. The society at Paris, to one who has all
your advantages for enjoying it in its perfection, is, I am
fully convinced, from all that I have heard, the most
agreeable in the whole world.</p>

<p>Our education here is at present in high reputation. The
Englishes are crowding down upon us every season, and I wish
may not come to hurt us at the last.<a name="FNanchor_229:1_197" id="FNanchor_229:1_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_229:1_197" class="fnanchor">[229:1]</a></p>

kindled such a flame, that the old burning bush was like to

<p>It is pleasing to find one whose name has been so much associated with
the later school of our national literature, as Mrs. Cockburn, the early
friend of Scott, enjoying the intimacy of the sages of the philosophical
age of Scottish letters. This accomplished lady, well known as the
authoress of one of the versions of "The Flowers of the Forest," was a
correspondent of Hume. A few of her letters have been preserved; and the
following are her free and animated remarks on Hume's flattering
reception in France,&mdash;remarks written in the full assurance that neither
adulation nor prosperity would diminish the regard of that simple manly
heart, for the chosen friends he had left in his native soil.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">

<p>From the bleak hills of the north, from the uncultured
daughter of Caledon, will the adored sage of France deign to
receive a few lines: they come from the <em>heart</em> of a friend,
and will be delivered by the <em>hand</em> of an enemy. Which, O man
of mode, is most indifferent to thee? Insensible thou art
alike to gratitude or resentment; fit for the country that
worships thee. Thou art equally insensible to love or hate. A
momentary applause, ill begot, and worse brought <!-- Page 231 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_231" id="Page_v2_231">[231]</a></span>up,&mdash;an
abortion, a fame not founded on truth,&mdash;have bewitched thee,
and thou hast forgot those who, overlooking thy errors, saved
thy worth. Idol of Gaul, I worship thee not. The very cloven
foot, for which thou art worshipped, I despise: yet I remember
<em>thee</em> with affection. I remember that, in spite of vain
philosophy, of dark doubts, of toilsome learning, God had
stamped his image of benignity so strong upon thy <em>heart</em>,
that not all the labours of thy head could efface it. Idol of
a foolish people, be not puffed up; it is easy to overturn the
faith of a multitude that is ready to do evil: an apostle of
less sense might bring to that giddy nation&mdash;libertinism;
liberty they are not born to. This will be sent to you by your
good friend, Mr. Burnet; who goes much such an errand as you
have given yourself through life, viz., in search of truth;
and I believe both are equally impartial in the search;

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 3d September, 1764.</p>

<p>"It is certain that nothing could be a greater inducement to
me to continue my History, than your desiring so earnestly I
should do so. I have so great reason to be satisfied with your
conduct towards me, that I wish very much to gratify you in
every thing that is practicable; and there want not other
motives to make me embrace that resolution. For, though I
think I have reason to complain of the blindness of party,
which has made the public do justice to me very slowly, and
with great reluctance, yet I find that I obtain support from
many impartial people; and hope that I shall every day have
more reason to be satisfied in that particular. But, in my
present situation, it is impossible for me to undertake such a
<!-- Page 232 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_232" id="Page_v2_232">[232]</a></span>work; and I cannot break off from Lord Hertford, as long as
he is pleased to think me useful to him. I shall not, however,
lose sight of this object; and any materials that cast up, in
this country, shall be carefully collected by me.</p>

<p>"I am glad you are satisfied with the publication of the new
edition of my Essays. I shall be obliged to you if you will
inform yourself exactly how many copies are now sold, both of
that edition and of the octavo edition of my History. I think
both these editions very correct. I did little more than see
your friends, Mr. Buchanan and Mr. Wilson, at Paris, and
present them to Lord Hertford. We returned not from Compiegne
till a few days before they left Paris.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I think the
Duchess of Douglas has chosen well in making Mallet one of her
commissioners. I have no good opinion of that cause. Mrs.
Mallet has retired into the forest of Fontainbleau with a
Macgregor. I fancy she is angry with me, and thought herself
neglected by me while in Paris. I heard of her thrusting
herself every where into companies, who endeavoured to avoid
her; and I was afraid she would have laid hold of me to
enlarge her acquaintance among the French. I have not yet
executed your commission with Mons<sup>r</sup>. le Roy, but shall not
forget it. I am very glad that Mrs. Millar is so good as to
remember me. I shall regard it as one agreeable circumstance
attending my return to England, that you and she will have
leisure to give more of your company to your friends; and I
shall always be proud to be ranked in the number.</p>

<p>"The lowness of stocks surely proceeds not from any
apprehension of war: never was a general peace established in
Europe with more likelihood of its continuance; but I fancy
your stocks are become at last <!-- Page 233 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_233" id="Page_v2_233">[233]</a></span>too weighty, to the conviction
of all the world. What must happen, if we go on at the same
rate during another war? I am, with great sincerity, dear sir,
your most obedient humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_233:1_200" id="FNanchor_233:1_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:1_200" class="fnanchor">[233:1]</a></p>

<p>The course of correspondence with Elliot, which commences with the next
following letter, relates, in a great measure, to the disposal of his
two sons at Paris, and to their future training and education.<a name="FNanchor_233:2_201" id="FNanchor_233:2_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_233:2_201" class="fnanchor">[233:2]</a>
There could be no better evidence of the reliance placed in Hume's
honourable principles and knowledge of the world, by those friends who
were sufficiently intimate with him, fully to appreciate his character;
while his whole conduct in the transaction shows kindness of heart, with
a warm attachment to friends, and an earnest disposition to serve them.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;My departure from Paris was so very sudden, that
I was obliged to leave many of my little schemes uncompleted;
and, what was still more mortifying, to see the progress of
all my growing attachments cruelly interrupted. I reached this
place just in time, though not a little retarded by the
Russian chancellor and his forty horses. Had I but foreseen
this obstruction, I might as well have set out on Wednesday
morning at two o'clock; and in that case, <!-- Page 234 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_234" id="Page_v2_234">[234]</a></span>my dear
philosopher, what a delicious evening should I have passed in
your company.</p>

<p>Upon full deliberation I am determined to send you my boys, if
a tolerable place can be found for their reception. I did not
much like that talking professor, who undertakes so largely:
if nothing better can be done, pray take the trouble to renew
my negotiation with Madame Anson. Her house, though not just
what I could wish, is, however, not much amiss. I must not
lose this occasion of sending my children to France. I shall
never find any other so favourable. It will be no small
consolation to their mother, from whom they are now to be
separated for the first time, to know that we are not without
a friend in Paris, who will sometimes have an eye to their
conduct. If I am not too partial, I think you will find in
their character much native simplicity, and perhaps some
little elevation of mind. Send them back to me, my dear sir,
with the same qualities, tempered, if you will, but not
impaired by the acquisition of some few of those graces which
spread such an inexpressible charm through those societies
where even you are not ashamed to pass so many precious hours.</p>

<p>If you should find no leisure to give them a moment's
instruction, tell them at least to look up to the conduct and
character of a young friend of ours at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_234:1_202" id="FNanchor_234:1_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_234:1_202" class="fnanchor">[234:1]</a> There
they will find a model, which, without hoping to equal, it
will, however, become them to copy. But, after all, what am I
about? At Paris, to have children at all, is <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de plus mauvais
ton de monde</i>, and I forgot to inform myself, when one happens
to have them, whether it be <em>permitted</em> to take any thought
about them. I am impatient to hear from you at London. I shall
not be long there. I desire you would take this important
business into your hands and settle it for me entirely. I will
send them over the moment you desire me, and consigned to whom
you direct,&mdash;the sooner the better: you will settle all other
particulars as you find proper. Before I conclude, allow me in
friendship also to tell you, I think I see you at present upon
the very brink of <!-- Page 235 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_235" id="Page_v2_235">[235]</a></span>a precipice. One cannot too much clear
their mind of all little prejudices, but partiality to one's
country is not a prejudice. Love the French as much as you
will. Many of the individuals are surely the proper objects of
affection; but, above all, continue still an Englishman. You
know, better than any body, that the active powers of our mind
are much too limited to be usefully employed in any pursuit
more general than the service of that portion of mankind which
we call our country. General benevolence and private
friendship will attend a generous mind and a feeling heart,
into every country; but political attachment confines itself
to one.</p>

<p>I have not now leisure to trouble you with the few
observations my too short stay at Paris had but imperfectly
furnished me with. Irreconcileable to the principles of their
government, I am delighted with the amenity and gentleness of
their manners. I was even pleased to find that the severity
and rigour of our English climate had not rendered me
altogether insensible to the kind impressions of a milder sky.
May I trouble you with my most cordial and sincere respects to
Lord and Lady Hertford. Some French names, too, I could
mention, but I am not vain enough to imagine that I can, upon
so short an acquaintance, have a place in their remembrance.
Believe me, very dear sir, yours very sincerely, and most
affectionately,</p>

<p class="center">(I set out this moment.)</p>

<p class="datelineit">Brussels, 15th September, 1764.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 22d Sept. 1764.</p>

<p>"As soon as I received yours from Brussels, I set on foot my
inquiries. I spoke to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Hooke</span>, to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Père Gordon</span>, to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Clairaut</span>,
to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Pri</span>, and to others, <!-- Page 236 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_236" id="Page_v2_236">[236]</a></span>with a view of finding some
proper settlement for your young gentlemen. Every body told
me, as <em>they</em> did, of the difficulty of succeeding in my
scheme; and nothing yet has been offered me, that I would
advise you to accept of. I went to Madame Anson's, and found
that family a very decent, sensible kind of people. I came in
upon them about seven o'clock, and found a company of eight or
nine persons assembled, whose aspects pleased me very much.
The only objection that occurred to me with regard to this
family, is the quarter of the town, which is not only so
unfashionable, that my coachman was astonished when I ordered
him to drive thither, but, what is worse, it is far from all
walks and places of exercise. However, it is near the
university; and, consequently, it is in that quarter where all
the youth of France are educated. If nothing better present
itself, I shall conclude a bargain with this family for a
thousand crowns a-year, without firing or washing, according
to the terms proposed to you, which they said they could not
depart from. The misfortune is, that I must go to Fontainbleau
in about a fortnight, and, consequently, am straitened in my
time of inquiry; but, in all cases, I shall certainly conclude
with somebody before my departure. We stay six weeks at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fontainbleau</span>, during which time, if you send your sons to
Paris, I shall take a journey thither to receive them. In all
cases, they must come immediately to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hotel de Brancas</span>,
where they will not want friends.</p>

<p>"I do not like the talking man more than you do; and a
flattering letter I have since received from him, does not
augment my good opinion. I went to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur Bastide</span>, he who
proposed the scheme for ten thousand livres a-year. He seems
to be a genteel, well-bred man; lives in a very good house in
an excellent <!-- Page 237 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_237" id="Page_v2_237">[237]</a></span>quarter of the town; is well spoke of by
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> and others; and has with him two very agreeable
boys, Russian princes, who speak French very well. I should
have given him the preference, had it not been the price. He
asks ten thousand livres a-year for your two sons and their
governor, without supplying them either with clothes or
masters. You know his ten thousand a-piece included all
expenses. If you can resolve to go so far in point of expense,
it is the best place that occurs, or is likely to occur.</p>

<p>"Since I wrote the above, I went to see <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
L'Espinasse</span>, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert's</span> mistress, who is really one of the
most sensible women in Paris. She told me that there could not
be a worthier, honester, better man, than Bastide. I told her
that I had entertained the same opinion, but was afraid his
head-piece was none of the best. She owned that he did not
excel on that side; and a proof of it was, that he had wrote
several books, all of which were below middling. On my return
home, I found the enclosed letter from him.<a name="FNanchor_237:1_204" id="FNanchor_237:1_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_237:1_204" class="fnanchor">[237:1]</a> I have
promised him an answer by the return of the post from England.
On the whole, the chief advantage, as it appears to me, which
his house will have above Anson's, consists in the air and
situation. It lies on the skirts of the town, in an open
street near the rampart; but five thousand livres a-year is
paying too dear for the advantage.</p>

<p>"I cannot imagine what you mean by saying I am on a precipice.
I shall foretell to you the result of my present situation
almost with as great certainty as it is possible to employ
with regard to any future event. As soon as Lord Hertford's
embassy ends, which <!-- Page 238 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_238" id="Page_v2_238">[238]</a></span>probably may not continue long, some
zealot, whom I never saw, and never could offend, finding me
without protection, will instanter fly, with alacrity, to
strike off that pension which the king and the ministry,
before I would consent to accept of my present situation,
promised should be for life. I shall be obliged to leave
Paris, which I confess I shall turn my back to with regret. I
shall go to Thoulouse or Montauban, or some provincial town in
the south of France, where I shall spend, contented, the rest
of my life, with more money, under a finer sky, and in better
company than I was born to enjoy.</p>

<p>"From what human motive or consideration can I prefer living
in England than in foreign countries? I believe, taking the
continent of Europe, from Petersburg to Lisbon, and from
Bergen to Naples, there is not one who ever heard of my name,
who has not heard of it with advantage, both in point of
morals and genius. I do not believe there is one Englishman in
fifty, who, if he heard I had broke my neck to-night, would be
sorry. Some, because I am not a Whig; some because I am not a
Christian; and all because I am a Scotsman. Can you seriously
talk of my continuing an Englishman? Am I, or are you, an
Englishman? Do they not treat with derision our pretensions to
that name, and with hatred our just pretensions to surpass and
govern them? I am a citizen of the world; but if I were to
adopt any country, it would be that in which I live at
present, and from which I am determined never to depart,
unless a war drives me into Switzerland or Italy.</p>

<p>"I must now inform you what passed with regard to my affair at
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'ile-Adam</span>.<a name="FNanchor_238:1_205" id="FNanchor_238:1_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_238:1_205" class="fnanchor">[238:1]</a> My friend showed me a <!-- Page 239 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_239" id="Page_v2_239">[239]</a></span>letter, which she
had lately received from Lord Tavistock, by which it appears
he had fallen into great friendship, and bore a great regard
to Lady Sarah Bunbury. I instantly forbade her to write to
England a line about my affair. I bear too great a respect to
her, to expose her to ask a favour, where there was so little
probability of success: thus have vanished my best hopes of
obtaining justice in this point. Here is surely no new ground
of attachment to England."<a name="FNanchor_239:1_206" id="FNanchor_239:1_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_239:1_206" class="fnanchor">[239:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hotel de Brancas</span>, 30th Sept. 1764.</p>

<p>"After acknowledging that I received both your letters, that
from Brussels, and that from Calais, I should be ashamed to
appear before you with so late a letter. This day fortnight,
Lord March and Selwin appointed to go off. I sent March a very
long letter for you, and enjoined him, as he lived next door
to you, to deliver it the moment he arrived; and having thus
done my duty, I went very contentedly to L'ile-Adam, where I
remained for four days. On my return to Paris, I was much
surprised to hear that March, after his post-chaise was yoked,
had <!-- Page 241 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_241" id="Page_v2_241">[241]</a></span>changed his mind, and was still in Paris. When I appeared
alarmed at this intelligence, I was told that he had sent off
an express to London with letters, which composed my mind.
Next day I saw him, and he fairly confessed, that from
forgetfulness, he had not sent off my letter. I begged him to
send it to me; he promised it, delayed it, promised again, and
at last owns that he has lost it; which gives me great
vexation, both on your account, and my own, for I spoke to you
with great freedom, and am infinitely uneasy lest my letter
should fall into bad hands.<a name="FNanchor_241:1_207" id="FNanchor_241:1_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_241:1_207" class="fnanchor">[241:1]</a> When I rail at March, I get
no other reply than, 'God damn you! if your letter was of
consequence, why the devil did you trust it to such a foolish
fellow as me?' I am therefore obliged, in a great hurry, to
give you some imperfect account of what I have done. I went to
Ansons', who seem a discreet, sober set of people. I came in
upon a mixed company, whose looks pleased me: the only
objection is the quarter of the town, which is straitened; but
it is near the University, and consequently where all the
youth of France are educated. I do not like the talking man
more than you; and a very flattering letter he wrote me,
helped further to disgust me. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Bastide</span>, the 10,000 livres
man, I went to see: he seems an agreeable man, and is well
spoke of; he lives in an agreeable house, and in a good air,
and has two young Russian princes with him, who speak very
good French; he offers to take your two boys and preceptor for
8000 livres on the whole, but without paying either clothes or
master. I suppose you would not choose to pay 5000 livres
a-year, merely for the advantage of better air. I have heard a
very good character of one Eriot, professor of rhetoric in the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Collège de Beauvais</span>, who offers to take <!-- Page 242 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_242" id="Page_v2_242">[242]</a></span>them: they would live
in the house with him alone; but he proposes that they should
go to all the classes of the university, where they would make
acquaintance with French boys, and nobody would ever ask
questions about their religion: But as I heard you declare
against their going to the university, (which yet I should
highly approve of,) I cannot make any bargain with Eriot. The
misfortune is, I go to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fontainbleau</span> to-morrow se'ennight, and
must conclude a bargain without hearing from you, by this fine
trick Lord March has played me. It is probable, therefore, it
will be with Anson, because you yourself did not disapprove of
that plan; and I should be afraid to depart from it
considerably, without your authority. If you give me
information in time, I shall come from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fontainbleau</span> to settle
your boys. In any case make them come immediately to the Hotel
de Brancas, where they will not want friends if any of the
family be in town.</p>

<p>"Since I wrote the above, one of my numerous scouts came to
me, and told me, that within gunshot of the Hotel de Brancas,
there was to be found all I could wish, and more than I could
have imagined. It is called <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Pension Militaire</span>. I
immediately went to see it. I found there an excellent airy
house, with an open garden belonging to it. It is the best
house but one in Paris; has a prospect and access into the
large open space of the Invalids, and from thence into the
fields. The number of boys is limited to thirty-five, whom I
saw in the court, in a blue uniform with a narrow silver lace.
They left off their play, and made me a bow with the best
grace in the world, as I passed. I was carried to their master
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Choquart</span>, who appeared to me a sensible, sedate,
judicious man, agreeable to the character I had <!-- Page 243 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_243" id="Page_v2_243">[243]</a></span>received of
him. He carried me through the boys' apartments, which were
cleanly, light, spacious, and each lay in a small bed apart. I
saw a large collection of instruments for experimental
philosophy. I saw an ingenious machine for teaching
chronology. There were plans of fortification. While I was
considering these, I heard a drum beat in the court. It was
the hour for assembling the boys for their military exercises.
I went down. They had now all got on their belts, and had
their muskets in their hands. They went through all the
Prussian exercises with the best air and greatest regularity
imaginable. Almost all were about your son's age, a year or
two more or less. They are the youth of the best quality in
France; their air and manners seemed to bespeak it. The master
asked only about thirteen hundred livres a-year for each of
your boys, five hundred for the preceptor. He supplies them
with all masters, except those of dancing, music, and
designing; for these they have masters that come in, who take
only eight livres a-month, though they require from others
three louis-d'ors. There is a riding master belonging to the
house. Your sons need never go to mass unless they please, and
nobody shall ever talk to them about religion; the master only
requires, that you should write him a letter, which he will
read to every body, by which you desire .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;."<a name="FNanchor_243:1_208" id="FNanchor_243:1_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_243:1_208" class="fnanchor">[243:1]</a></p>

<p>The following short letter was addressed to Mr. Elliot on the same day
with the preceding one, for the reason which the letter itself states.
The anxious care with which Hume endeavoured not only to be punctual and
exact himself in the performance of the business he had undertaken, but
to remedy the <!-- Page 244 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_244" id="Page_v2_244">[244]</a></span>consequences of the absence of these qualities in others,
may afford a useful reproof to those who demean themselves as above the
exercise of these homely virtues; and shows that the practice of them
has been, in one instance at least, considered not incompatible with the
design and achievement of intellectual greatness.</p>

<p>"I have wrote you a long letter to London, a short one to
Harrowgate, and now I write to you to Minto. Not to lose time,
you must have a little implicit faith; without making further
questions, give instantly orders that your sons be sent to me,
and that they come instantly to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Hotel de Brancas</span>. Within
less than a gunshot of this, I have found a place which has
all advantages beyond what your imagination could suggest; it
is almost directly opposite to my friend the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marechale de
Mirepoix's</span>, by whose advice I act. I tell you this, lest your
opinion of my discretion be not the highest in the world.
There are there about thirty boys of the best families in
France. The house is spacious, airy, clean, has a garden,
opens into the fields; the board costs only thirteen hundred
livres a-year for each boy, five hundred for the tutor; the
boys have almost all masters for this sum. I have concluded
the bargain for a quarter; the payment runs on from the first
of October, because the course of studies begins then; there
will be no question about religion or the mass. I have been
more particular in my letter to London. Nothing was ever so
fortunate for your purpose."</p>

also. Mr. Trail, the chaplain, and Mr. Larpent, my lord's
secretary, follow in a few days. All these arrangements are
unexpected; but the consequence is, that there will be nobody
in the Hotel de Brancas for some weeks; but this need not
retard a moment your sending the young gentlemen. I have spoke
to the master of the academy, who says that the moment they
arrive they shall be settled as well as if all their kindred
were there. I have sent the enclosed letter to him, which the
gentleman who attends them may deliver immediately on his
arrival in Paris. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Vive valeque.</span>"<a name="FNanchor_245:1_209" id="FNanchor_245:1_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_245:1_209" class="fnanchor">[245:1]</a></p>

<p>In 1764, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comte de Boufflers</span> died, and his widow expected to be made
Princess of Conti. Hume seems to have seen from the first that this
expectation was likely to lead to manifold mortifications, and that it
<!-- Page 246 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_246" id="Page_v2_246">[246]</a></span>was the duty of a true friend to prepare her mind for disappointment.
In this spirit he wrote her the following long and carefully considered
letters, in answer to some communications from her, full of hopes and
fears, and all a Frenchwoman's nervous agitations.</p>

<p>You may believe that, ever since my return to Paris, I have
kept my eyes and ears open with regard to every thing that
concerns your affair. I find it is the general opinion of all
those who think themselves the best informed, that a
resolution is taken in your favour; and that the resolution
will probably have place. But you do not expect surely, that
so great an event will pass without censure. It would ill
become my friendship to flatter you on this head. The envy and
jealousy of the world would alone account for a repugnance in
many. Nobody has been more generally known than you; both of
late and in your early youth. Will so numerous an acquaintance
be pleased to see you pass, from being their equal, to be so
much their superior? Will they bear your uniting the decisive
elevation of rank to the elevation of genius, which they feel,
and which they would in vain contest? Be assured, that she is
really and sincerely your friend, who can willingly yield you
so great advantages.</p>

<p>But though I hear some murmurs of this kind, I have likewise
the consolation to meet with several who entertain opposite
sentiments. I was told of a man of superior sense, nowise
connected with you, who maintained in a public company, that,
if the report was true, nothing could give him a higher idea
of the laudable and noble principles of your friend. The
execution of his purpose, he said, could not only be
justified, but seemed a justice due to you. The capital point
is to interpose as few delays as possible. Time must create
obstacles, and can remove none. While the matter seems in
suspense, many will declare themselves with violence against
you, and will render themselves irreconcilable enemies by such
declarations. They might be the <!-- Page 247 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_247" id="Page_v2_247">[247]</a></span>first to pay court to you,
had no leisure been allowed them to display their envy and
malignity.</p>

<p>On the whole, I am fully persuaded, from what I hear and see,
that the matter will end as we wish. But in all cases, I
foresee, that, let the event be what it will, you will reap
from it much honour and much vexation. Alas! dear madam, the
former is never a compensation for the latter: especially to
you, whose delicate frame, already shaken by an incident of
much less importance surely, is ill calculated to bear such
violent agitations. Pardon these sentiments if you think them
mean. They are dictated by my friendship for you. I am indeed
so mean as to wish you alive and healthy and gay in any
fortune. A fine consolation for us truly, to see the epithet
of princess inscribed on your grave, while we reflect that it
contains what was the most amiable in the world? I propose to
pay my respects to you the beginning of next week.</p>
</div>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">10th December, 1764.</p>

<p>It is needless to inform you, how much you employed my
thoughts in this great crisis of your fortune, of your health,
of your life itself. You could perceive, by undoubted signs,
that I partook sincerely of the violent anxieties, by which I
found you agitated; and that, after having endeavoured in vain
to appease the tumult of your passions, I was at last
necessitated myself to take part in your distress. My sympathy
is not abated by absence. I find myself incapable almost of
other occupation or amusement.</p>

<p>You still recur to my memory. The chief relief I have is in
writing to you, and throwing together some thoughts, which
occur to me, on your subject.</p>

<p>They are mostly the same which occurred in conversation, and
which I have already suggested to you. They will acquire no
additional authority at present in writing, except by
convincing you that they are the result of my most mature
reflections.</p>

<p>Of all your friends, I, as a foreigner, am perhaps the least
capable of giving you advice on so delicate a subject: I only
challenge the preference, in the warmth of my affection and
esteem towards you; and I am, as a foreigner, the farther
removed from all suspicion of separate interests and regards.</p>

<p><!-- Page 248 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_248" id="Page_v2_248">[248]</a></span>I cannot too often repeat, what I inculcated on you with great
earnestness, that, even if your friend should fix his
resolution on the side least favourable to you, you ought to
receive his determination without the least resentment. You
know that princes, more than other men, are born slaves to
prejudices, and that this tax is imposed on them, as a species
of retaliation by the public. This prince in particular is in
every view so eminent, that he owes some account of his
conduct to Europe in general, to France, and to his family,
the most illustrious in the world. It is expected, that men,
in his station, shall not be actuated by private regards. It
is expected, that with them friendship, affection, sympathy,
shall be absorbed in ambition, and in the desire of supporting
their rank in the world; and, if they fail in this duty, they
will meet with blame from a great part of the public. Can you
be surprised, that a person covetous of honour, should be
moved by these considerations? If he neglected them, would not
your grateful heart suggest to you, that he had taken an
extraordinary step in your favour? And can you, with any
grace, complain, that an extraordinary event has not happened,
merely because you wished for it, and found it desirable?</p>

<p>I am fully sensible, madam, of the force of those arguments
which you urged, not to justify your resentment, [from] which
you declared you would ever be exempted, but to maintain the
reasonableness of your expectations. I am fully sensible of
the regard, the sacred regard, due to a long and sincere
attachment, which, passing from love to friendship, lost
nothing of its warmth, and acquired only the additional merit
of reason and constancy. This regard, I own, is really
honourable and virtuous; and may safely be opposed to the
maxims of an imaginary honour, which, depending upon modes and
prejudices, will always be regarded, by great minds, as a
secondary consideration. I shall add, what your modesty would
not allow you to surmise, or even, perhaps, to think, that an
extraordinary step, taken in favour of extraordinary merit,
will always justify itself; and will appear but an ordinary
tribute. Allow me to do you this justice in your present
melancholy situation. I know I am exempt from flattery: I
believe I am exempt from partiality. <!-- Page 249 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_249" id="Page_v2_249">[249]</a></span>The zeal and fervour
which move me, are the effects, not the causes of my judgment.</p>

<p>But, my dear friend, the consideration, which is the most
interesting, the most affecting, the most alarming, is the
immediate danger of your health and life, from the violent
situation into which fortune has now thrown you. You continued
long to live, with tolerable tranquillity, though exposed to
many vexations, in a state little befitting your worth and
merit; and you still comforted yourself by reflecting that you
could not change it, without withdrawing from a friendship
dearer to you than life itself. You still could flatter
yourself, that the person, for whose sake you made this
sacrifice, if he had it in his power, would, at any price,
repair your honour, and fortify his connexions with you. The
unexpected death of M. de Boufflers has put an end to these
illusions. It has at once brought you within reach of honour
and felicity: and has thrown a poison on your former state, by
rendering it still less honourable than before.</p>

<p>You cannot say, madam, that I do not feel, and with the most
pungent sensation, the cruelty of your situation. I am
sensible too, that time will scarcely bring any remedy to this
evil.</p>

<p>The loss of a friend, of a dignity, of fortune, admits of
consolation, if not from reason, at least from oblivion; and
these sorrows are not eternal. But while you maintain your
present connexions, your hopes, still kept alive, will still
enliven your natural desire of that state to which you aspire,
and your disgust towards that state in which you will find
yourself. I foresee that your lively passions, continually
agitated, will tear in pieces your tender frame: melancholy
and a broken constitution may then prove your lot, and the
remedy which could now preserve your health and peace of mind,
may come too late to restore them.</p>

<p>What advice, then, can I give you, in a situation so
interesting? The measure which I recommend to you requires
courage, but I dread that nothing else will be able to prevent
the consequences, so justly apprehended. It is, in a word,
that after employing every gentle art to prevent a rupture,
<!-- Page 250 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_250" id="Page_v2_250">[250]</a></span>you should gradually diminish your connexion with the Prince,
should be less assiduous in your visits, should make fewer and
shorter journeys to his country seats, and should betake
yourself to a private, and sociable, and independent life at
Paris. By this change in your plan of living, you cut off at
once the expectations of that dignity to which you aspire; you
are no longer agitated with hopes and fears; your temper
insensibly recovers its former tone; your health returns; your
relish for a simple and private life gains ground every day,
and you become sensible, at last, that you have made a good
exchange of tranquillity for grandeur. Even the dignity of
your character, in the eyes of the world, recovers its lustre,
while men see the just price you set upon your liberty; and
that, however the passions of youth may have seduced you, you
will not now sacrifice all your time, where you are not deemed
worthy of every honour.</p>

<p>And why should you think with reluctance on a private life at
Paris? It is the situation for which I thought you best
fitted, ever since I had the happiness of your acquaintance.
The inexpressible and delicate graces of your character and
conversation, like the soft notes of a lute, are lost amid the
tumult of company, in which I commonly saw you engaged. A more
select society would know to set a juster value upon your
merit. Men of sense, and taste, and letters, would accustom
themselves to frequent your house. Every elegant society would
court your company. And though all great alterations in the
habits of living may, at first, appear disagreeable, the mind
is soon reconciled to its new situation, especially if more
congenial and natural to it. I should not dare to mention my
own resolutions on this occasion, if I did not flatter myself
that your friendship gives them some small importance in your
eyes. Being a foreigner, I dare less answer for my plans of
life, which may lead me far from this country; but if I could
dispose of my fate, nothing could be so much my choice as to
live where I might cultivate your friendship. Your taste for
travelling might also afford you a plausible pretence for
putting this plan in execution: a journey to Italy would
loosen your connexions here; and, if it were delayed some
time, I could, with some <!-- Page 251 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_251" id="Page_v2_251">[251]</a></span>probability, expect to have the
felicity of attending you thither.<a name="FNanchor_251:1_210" id="FNanchor_251:1_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_251:1_210" class="fnanchor">[251:1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Hume had the happiness of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span> sincerely at heart; and we
find him, on 24th June, 1765, thus writing to his brother:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I had great hopes, all the winter, of seeing the Countess in a station
suitable to her merit, and of paying my respects to her as part of the
royal family. Several accidents have disappointed us; and the various
turns of this affair have more agitated me than almost any event in
which I was ever engaged."</p>

<p>The following correspondence exhibits a feature in Hume's character,
which to many readers will be new, and perhaps unpleasing. It shows that
he was by no means exempt from the passion of anger, and that when under
its influence he was liable to be harsh and unreasonable. The general
notion formed of his character is, that he passed through life unmoved
and immovable, a placid mass of breathing flesh, on which the ordinary
impulses which rouse the human passions into life might expend
themselves in vain. We have seen that very early in life he had
undertaken the task of bringing his passions and propensities under the
yoke, and directing all his physical and mental energies to the
accomplishment of his early and never fading vision of literary renown.
From many indications which petty incidents in his life afford, it would
appear that the ardour of his nature, if thus regulated, was not
eradicated; and one cannot, in a general survey of his course and
character, reject the conclusion, that his early resolution not to enter
the lists as a controversial writer, mentioned in the following letter,
was suggested by a profound self-knowledge, and a <!-- Page 252 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_252" id="Page_v2_252">[252]</a></span>consciousness of his
inability to preserve his temper as a controversialist.</p>

<p>The person against whom all the wrath of the following letter is
directed, is the respectable author of the "Historical and Critical
Inquiry into the Evidence produced by the Earls Murray and Morton
against Mary Queen of Scots." That, assailed as he often was by attacks
so much more vehement and unscrupulous, Hume should have taken so deep
umbrage at this piece of free historical criticism, is a problem not
easily to be explained. It is not a little remarkable that the bitterest
remark on any contemporary contained in his published works, is a note
to his History, in which he has abbreviated the purport of the
letter.<a name="FNanchor_252:1_211" id="FNanchor_252:1_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_252:1_211" class="fnanchor">[252:1]</a></p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Elibank</span>.<a name="FNanchor_252:2_212" id="FNanchor_252:2_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_252:2_212" class="fnanchor">[252:2]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;As I am told that Dr. Robertson has wrote a few
remarks, which he communicated to your lordship, as our common
answer about the affair <!-- Page 253 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_253" id="Page_v2_253">[253]</a></span>of Queen Mary, and has endeavoured to
show you that it was contempt and not inability, which kept
him from making a public reply; I thought it would not be
amiss for me to imitate his example; and I did not indeed know
a properer person, nor a more equal judge than your lordship,
to whom I could submit the cause. For if, on the one hand,
your lordship's regard to the memory of that princess might
give you a bias to that side, I know, that the ancient and
constant friendship, with which your lordship has always
honoured me, both in public and private, would give you a
strong bias on my side; and there was a good chance for your
remaining neutral and impartial between these motives.</p>

<p>"I shall confine my apology to the account which I have given
of the conference at Hampton court, as this is indeed the
chief point, in which the answerer has thought proper to find
fault with me.</p>

<p>"There are several places, in which I mention Mary's refusal
to give any reply to Murray's charge, and have commonly said,
that she annexed as a condition, her being admitted to Queen
Elizabeth's presence; as in page 496, line 20; page 501, line
12, line 21.<a name="FNanchor_253:1_213" id="FNanchor_253:1_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_253:1_213" class="fnanchor">[253:1]</a> I have not said that this condition was an
unreasonable one, (the words which the answerer puts in my
mouth,) but only that it was such a one as she did not expect
to be granted; and that because Queen Elizabeth had formerly
refused it, before any positive proofs of Mary's guilt were
produced, merely from the general rumour and opinion, which
were unfavourable to her. Having thus clearly expressed myself
on this head, when I have occasion afterwards, in the course
of the narration, to mention the matter, I say once or <!-- Page 254 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_254" id="Page_v2_254">[254]</a></span>twice
simply, that Mary refused to give any answer, without
expressing the condition annexed by her. My reasons were, that
the position was sufficiently qualified by the preceding
narration; and because a refusal, grounded on a condition
which the person does not expect to be gratified, and which is
accordingly denied, is certainly equivalent to a simple and
absolute refusal.</p>

<p>"That your lordship may judge of the unfairness of the
answerer, he picks out this simple and unqualified expression
of mine, and omits the others, which explain it to the readers
of the meanest capacity; and he opposes it by a passage cited
with equal unfairness from Mr. Goodall's appendix. He quotes a
long passage from Goodall, p. 308, in which Queen Mary demands
copies of her letters, and offers positively to give an answer
without mentioning any conditions; and this detached passage
he opposes to the detached passage from me, in which I assert
that she absolutely refused to answer. He desires that this
express contradiction between my narration and the records may
be remarked. But, in the first place, the condition of being
admitted to Queen Elizabeth, though not mentioned in that
paper, is not relinquished, and it is even clearly implied;
because Mary there refers to a former letter, which we find in
Goodall, p. 283, line 2, from the bottom, page 289, line 13,
and where it is positively insisted on. Secondly, we have in
Goodall, page 184, Queen Mary's commission to break up the
conference, if that condition be not granted. Thirdly, Queen
Elizabeth understands her meaning very well, as indeed it was
very plain, and offers to her copies of the letters, if she
will promise to answer without any condition; see Goodall,
page 311, line 3, and this offer is not accepted of. Fourthly,
in the very last <!-- Page 255 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_255" id="Page_v2_255">[255]</a></span>paper of all, which closes the whole, the
Bishop of Ross still insists on that condition; Goodall, page
390 about the middle.</p>

<p>"You see, therefore, my lord, the double trick practised. A
mangled passage of my History is confronted with a mangled
passage of Mr. Goodall's papers, and by this gross fraud a
contradiction is pretended to be found between them. A single
forgery would not do the business.</p>

<p>"I believe it will divert your lordship to observe, that when
the answerer is employing these base artifices, this is the
very moment he chooses to call me liar and rascal. But that
trick is so frequently practised by thieves, pick-pockets, and
controversial writers, (gentlemen whose morality are pretty
much upon a footing,) that all the world has ceased to wonder,
and wise men are tired of complaining of it.</p>

<p>"I do not find that even this gentleman has ventured to
assert, that Queen Mary offered to answer Murray's accusation,
though she should be refused access to Queen Elizabeth. Where
then is the difference between us? He asserts, that she
offered to answer, if admitted to that queen. I say that she
refused to answer unless she was admitted, which are positive
and negative propositions of the same import.</p>

<p>"For a proof that Queen Mary's commission was finally revoked,
I beg your lordship to consult Goodall, p. 184, 311, 387,
where it is plainly asserted. The last quotation is from the
concluding paper of the whole collection.</p>

<p>"I hope your lordship, as my friend, will congratulate me on
the resolution I took in the beginning of my life, that is, of
my literary life, never to reply to any body. Otherwise this
gentleman, I mean this author, might have insulted me on my
silence. I am <!-- Page 256 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_256" id="Page_v2_256">[256]</a></span>sure your lordship would have disowned me for
ever as a friend, if I had entered the lists with such an
antagonist. Mr. Goodall is no very calm or indifferent
advocate in this cause; yet he disowns him as an associate,
and confesses to me and all the world, that I am here right in
my facts, and am only wrong in my inferences.</p>

<p>"There appear to me two infallible marks of our opposite
parties, and as we may say proof charges, which, if a man can
stand, there is no fear that any charge will ever burst him. A
Whig who believes the popish plot, and a Tory who asserts
Queen Mary's innocence, are certainly fitted to go all lengths
with their party. I am happy to think that such people are
both equally my enemies; and still more happy, that I have no
animosity at either.</p>

<p>"It is an old proverb, <em>Love me, love my dog</em>; but certainly
it admits of many exceptions. I am sure, at least, that I have
a great respect for your lordship, yet have none at all for
this dog of yours. On the contrary, I declare him to be a very
mangy cur; entreat your lordship to rid your hands of him as
soon as possible, and think a sound beating, or even a rope
too good for him."<a name="FNanchor_256:1_214" id="FNanchor_256:1_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_256:1_214" class="fnanchor">[256:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Lord Elibank's answer does not appear to have been preserved. It can
scarcely be supposed that the foregoing letter, or any one written in a
like spirit, is the communication which Hume characterizes in the
following letter as written "in a spirit of cordiality and amity," and
containing "every pathetic, every engaging sentiment and expression;"
<!-- Page 257 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_257" id="Page_v2_257">[257]</a></span>yet we afterwards find Lord Elibank sarcastically alluding to his
having been so stupid as to mistake the spirit thus described, for one
of a totally opposite tendency.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Lord Elibank</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Fontainbleau, 3d Nov. 1764.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Lord</span>,&mdash;In reply to the letter with which your lordship has
honoured me, I shall endeavour to be as clear and as concise
as possible. Your lordship should never have heard of the
short and slight disgust between your brother and me, had he
not told Sir James Macdonald that you was in such a passion
against me, on account of my conduct towards him, that you
intended instantly to compose a pamphlet against me, on the
subject of Queen Mary, and to publish it as a full revenge
upon me. You see that he insinuates the same thing in his
letter, and he says that you was <em>formerly my friend</em>. But the
whole story, I have now reason to see, was without foundation,
both from the tenor of your lordship's present letter, and
from a letter of yours delivered to me by Mons. Calvet, and
which is wrote in the usual friendly strain that had so long
subsisted between us. But not doubting at that time of Mr.
Murray's story, I dreaded the consequence of a pamphlet
composed and published by one of your lordship's temper in a
fit of rage, on a subject where you are naturally heated. I
knew that it would be full of expressions of the utmost
acrimony, which you yourself could not forgive, even were I
disposed to do so; and I may now add, that this last letter
proves you to be an excellent proficient in that style. I
wrote my letter in a spirit of cordiality and amity, that I
might prevent a rupture most disagreeable to me. I have no
objection <!-- Page 258 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_258" id="Page_v2_258">[258]</a></span>to the publishing any thing in opposition to my
opinions. On the contrary, there is nothing I desire more than
these discussions. I was far from threatening your lordship
with the loss of my friendship, which I was sensible could
never be of any consequence to you: I only foretold with
infinite regret, that if you wrote against me in a heat,
without allowing your temper to compose itself, it would be
impossible for us to be any longer friends. I employed every
pathetic, every engaging sentiment and expression to induce
your lordship to embrace this way of thinking. I shall venture
to say, that you have never in your life received a more
friendly and more obliging letter. I leave your lordship to
judge of the return it has met with.</p>

<p>"I composed my letter with great care, because I set a value
on your lordship's friendship. I was so much satisfied with it
myself, that I read it to a friend, who told me, that it would
be impossible for your lordship to resist so many mollifying
expressions, and that they would certainly bring you back to
our usual state of friendship. Under what power of fascination
have your eyes lain, when you could see every thing in a light
so directly opposite?</p>

<p>"I come now to the other ground of your complaint, my
indifference in the case of Mr. Murray. When I arrived in
Paris, the first question he asked me was, whether Lord Bute
or Mr. Stuart Mackenzie had recommended him to Lord Hertford,
that he might be received in the ambassador's house like other
British subjects. I asked my lord, who told me that neither of
these persons had ever mentioned Mr. Murray to him; he wished
they had; he desired to show all manner of civilities to Mr.
Murray. But he was afraid, that a person against whom a
public <!-- Page 259 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_259" id="Page_v2_259">[259]</a></span>proclamation had been issued, and who had openly lived
so many years with the Pretender, could not be received in his
house, unless he had previously received some assurances, that
the matter would give no offence. I told this to Mr Murray. He
was entirely satisfied. He only said that he would write again
to Mr. Stuart Mackenzie, who never wrote to Lord Hertford. In
this affair, then, Mr. Murray received all the favour which he
either desired or expected.</p>

<p>"But perhaps your lordship means, that I ought to have
befriended him in his law-suit with Mrs. Blake,&mdash;I suppose, by
taking his part in company. But who told you that I did not? I
have frequently desired people in general to suspend their
judgment; for as to any particular justification of him, I was
not capable of it, because I was and still am ignorant of all
particulars of his story. Whence could I learn them? From
himself, or from his antagonist, or from both? I assure your
lordship that I was otherwise employed, and more to my
satisfaction, than in unravelling an intricate story, which
the Parliament of Paris could not clear up in much less than
two years, and which, it is pretended, they have not cleared
up at last.</p>

<p>"But I need say no more on this head, since your brother a few
days after I wrote you sent me a letter, in which he asked
pardon for his former letter, acknowledged his error, and
desired a return of my friendship. His only ground of quarrel,
indeed, was a small negligence in returning his visits: an
offence which, operating on a man of his vanity, has engaged
him to do all this mischief.</p>

<p>"I have said that your lordship never received a letter more
friendly and obliging than my former letter: I hope you will
also acknowledge that this <!-- Page 260 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_260" id="Page_v2_260">[260]</a></span>is wrote with sufficient temper
and moderation. Adieu.</p>

<p>"I have the honour to be, with the greatest regard and
consideration, my lord, your lordship's most obedient, and
most humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_260:1_215" id="FNanchor_260:1_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_260:1_215" class="fnanchor">[260:1]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the pleasure to understand, by yours of the
&mdash;&mdash;, that I have never been altogether in disgrace with you;
I choose rather to pass for dull as mad, and it would have
been the highest proof of the latter, if I had taken any thing
ill of you, that I had not thought ill meant.</p>

<p>I own the compliment you say you intended me in your former
letter, was too refined for my genius. I really mistook it for
an intention to break with me; and as there is hardly any
thing I set a greater value on than your friendship, and I was
not conscious of having ever entertained a single idea
inconsistent with it, I could not resign it without pain and
resentment. Diffident of myself, I showed your letter to
several of our common friends, who all understood it as I did.
Had my affection for you been more moderate, my answer to
yours would have been cool in proportion. I am still mortified
to think you could suspect me of siding with my brother
against you. I know the distinction between relationship and
friendship. I have ever thought those connexions incompatible;
and if I was dull enough to mistake the meaning of your
letter, I have not more reason to blush, than you have for
suspecting, that any thing my brother could say, was capable
of influencing my sincere regard for a friend of thirty years'
standing, or that my zeal for the reputation of any prince,
dead or alive, could draw any sentiment or expression from me,
inconsistent with that admiration of your talents, as an
author, and merit as a man, I have constantly felt in myself,
and endeavoured to excite in others. I am, dear sir, your

Choquart. The remainder of the letter follows:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p>"As soon as I came from Fontainbleau, I went to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pension
Militaire</span>, so it is called, where I had first a conversation
with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span>. I found him exceedingly pleased with your boys:
he told me that whenever his two young pupils arrived, he
called together all the French gentlemen, who are to the
number of thirty or thirty-two, and he made them a harangue;
he then said to them, that they were all men of quality, to be
educated to the honourable profession of arms; that all their
wars would probably be with England; that France and that
kingdom, were Rome and Carthage, whose rivality more properly
than animosity never allowed long intervals of peace; that the
chance of arms might make them prisoners of arms to Messrs
Elliot, in which case it would be a happiness to them to meet
a private friend in a public enemy; that he knew many
instances of people whose lives were saved by such fortunate
events, and it therefore became them, from views of prudence,
and from the generosity for which the French nation was so
renowned, to give the best treatment to the young strangers,
whose friendship might probably endure, and be serviceable to
them through life: he added, that the effect of this harangue
was such, that, as soon as he presented your boys to their
companions, they all flew to them and embraced them, and have
ever since <!-- Page 262 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_262" id="Page_v2_262">[262]</a></span>continued to pay them all courtship and regard,
and to show them every mark of preference. Every one is
ambitious to acquire the friendship of the two young
Englishmen, who have already formed connexions more intimate
than ever I observed among his other pupils. '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce que
j'admire</i>,' added he, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dans vos jeunes amis est qu'ils ont
non seulement de l'esprit, mais de l'âme. Ils sont
véritablement attendris des témoinages d'amitié qu'on leur
rend. Ils méritent d'être aimés, parce qu'ils savent aimer.</i>'</p>

<p>"When I came next to converse with your boys, I found all this
representation exactly just: I believe they never passed
fourteen days in their life so happily as they did the last.
What I find strikes them much is the high titles of their
companions: there is not one, says Hugh, that is not a
marquis, or count, or chevalier at least. They are indeed all
of them of the best families in France, a nephew of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de
Choiseul</span>, two nephews of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Beninghen</span>, &amp;c. &amp;c. They are
frequently drawn out, and displayed after the Prussian manner.
I saw them go through their exercises with the greatest
exactness and best air. The Abbé remarked to me, that the
marching, and wheeling, and moving under arms, is better than
all the dancing schools in the world to give a noble carriage
to youth. Gilbert is such a proficient, that the master is
thinking already of advancing him to the first rank, if not of
making him a corporal: all this is excellent for Hugh, and if
Gilbert's head be a little too full with military ideas, this
inconvenience will easily be corrected, as far as it ought to
be corrected.</p>

<p>"The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> tells me, that in the short time they have been with
him, their accent is sensibly corrected, and he is persuaded
that, in three months' time, it will not be possible to
distinguish them from Frenchmen. <!-- Page 263 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_263" id="Page_v2_263">[263]</a></span>They are never to hear mass,
but to attend at the ambassador's chapel every Sunday. Such is
the general account I have to give you; their preceptor will
be more particular, and I shall visit them from time to
time."<a name="FNanchor_263:1_218" id="FNanchor_263:1_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_263:1_218" class="fnanchor">[263:1]</a></p>

birth mingled with whatever elements it thought fit, is perhaps the best
evidence of the security it felt in the haughty and arbitrary exercise
of its established privileges. With all this free equality of social
intercourse, however, there must have been something yet left to which
the mere guest was not admitted, and to which he never aspired. Without
this, it seems impossible that Actors,&mdash;menials by the etiquette of the
court, anathematized by the church, held incapable of giving evidence in
some courts of law as persons of infamous profession,&mdash;should have been
so much sought after and caressed. Thus the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le Kains, Fleurys</span>, and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prévilles</span>, among the men; the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Sophy Arnoulds, Dumesnils, Clairons</span>, among
the women, many of them thorough profligates, are to be found haunting
places surrounded by the highest lustre of adventitious rank, busying
themselves with state secrets, mingling in family disputes, and always
with the easy assurance of their profession. This state of matters could
not have existed unless the aristocracy, notwithstanding the ease with
which they permitted themselves to be approached, were able effectually
to mark precisely the point where the advance was to stop, and could
feel themselves among persons, who, like old family servants, never
presume upon familiarity. In admitting to social intercourse, however, a
person of Hume's dignity of character and position in literature, there
could be no such reserves, and the intercourse must have been as really
on terms of familiarity as it appeared to be.</p>

<div class="bqfn">
<p class="letterdateit">"Potsdam, 11th September, 1764.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Le plaisir de votre lettre, et l'assurance d'amitié de Madame Geoffrin
et de Monsieur D'Alembert a été bien rabattu par ce que vous me dites de
l'état de la santé de M. D'Alembert. Sobre comme il est à table&mdash;comment
peut-il avoir des maux d'estomac? Il faut qu'il travaille trop de la
tête à des calculs, ou qu'il allume sa chandelle par les deux bouts.
C'est cela sans doute. Renvoyez-le ici à mon hermitage. Je le rendrai à
sa, ou ses belles, frais, reposé, se portant à merveille.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Apropos de mon hermitage dont M. de Malsan vous a fait la description,
il a voyagé avec Panurge, et a été chez <em>oui-dire tenant école de
temorgnerie</em>. Primo, ma petite maison ne subsiste pas&mdash;par conséquence
mon grand hôte ne pouvoit m'y honorer de sa présence. 2do, Elle ne sera
pas si petite, ayant 89 pieds de façade avec deux ailes de 45 pieds de
long. Le jardin est petit, assez grand cependant pour moi, et j'ai une
clef pour entrer aux jardins de Sans-Souci. Il y aura une belle salle
avec un vestibule, et un cabinet assez grand pour y mettre un lit, tout
apart des autres apartements. Si D'Alembert venoit, il pouroit y loger,
et prendre les eaux; mais il est peu-que probable, que le grand hôte me
disputeroit, et emporteroit cet avantage. En attendant son arrivée, j'y
logerai mon ancien ami Michel de Montaigne, Ariosto, Voltaire, Swift, et

repeated by others who should be equally well informed, her conduct, put
in plain language, comes to this. That she had made up her mind to raise
her position by a distinguished marriage. That in this view, looking to
one object after another, she finally determined boldly to experiment on
M. Mora, the son of the Spanish ambassador. That as this young gentleman
had been recalled by his family to Spain, she fraudulently procured a
certificate from an eminent physician, to the effect that a return to
the climate of France was essential to his safety; and that he died on
his journey back. But not less singular than the tale itself, is the
good-humoured simplicity with which it is told, as something rather
commendable than otherwise. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marmontel</span> tells it, not omitting to state
how he used to run to the post-office for M. Mora's letters, in the
midst of that amusing series of sketches, the leading charm of which is
their amiable author's utter unconsciousness that his narrative is ever
likely to be scrutinized by people so educated and trained, as to look
upon his pleasant frailties as detestable vices, and the whole system of
society, so loveable and interesting in his eyes, as hideous. These
things indeed are mysteries; and read and ponder as we may, we cannot
enter into their spirit, but must view them as strange, distant, and
unnatural objects.</p>

<p>There is reason, however, to believe, that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marmontel's</span> account of
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Espinasse</span> is far from being accurate. See the article on <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Deffand's</span> and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'Espinasse's</span> letters, in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite> , vol. xv. p. 459,
where, as also in the article, vol. xvii. p. 290, a fuller view of the
character of the French literary circles of that day will be found than
any where else in the English language. The doubts of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marmontel's</span>
accuracy in the former of these articles, are singularly confirmed by
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memoires</span> of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marmontel's</span> uncle-in-law, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morellet</span>, published in 1832,

consented, provided the ring were of plain gold without ornament. The
ring when it made its appearance was plain indeed, but the portrait was
covered by a large diamond cut flat like glass. Madame Blot preserved
the ring and the picture, but returned the diamond. The prince pounded
the diamond to powder, and wrote the lady a letter strewed with the
diamond dust as drying sand.</p>

was destined to afford him an opportunity of becoming "the mode"
himself. This he tells us was the effect of his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu d'esprit</span> on
Rousseau, with which we shall hereafter have concern; and he tells it in
a manner which shows that, however contemptible when set in the brow of
David Hume, the chaplet of fashionable renown was not felt to be
unbecoming on his own. Thus, he says to Mr. Conway, on 12th January,
1766, "I almost repent having come hither, for I like the way of life
and many of the people so well, that I doubt I shall feel more regret at
leaving Paris than I expected. It would sound vain to tell you the
honours and distinctions I receive, and how much I am in fashion. Yet
when they come from the handsomest women in France, and the most
respectable in point of character, can one help being a little proud? If
I was twenty years younger, I should wish they were not quite so
respectable. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Brionne</span>, whom I have never seen, and who was to
have met me at supper last night, at the charming <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame D'Egmont's</span>,
sent me an invitation by the latter for Wednesday next. I was engaged
and hesitated: I was told, '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comment! savez-vous que c'est qu'elle ne
feroit pas pour toute La France.</span>' However, lest you should dread my
returning a perfect old swain, I study my wrinkles, compare myself and
my limbs to every plate of larks I see, and treat my understanding with
at least as little mercy. Yet, do you know, my present fame is owing to
a very trifling composition, but which has made incredible noise. I was
one evening at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin's</span>, joking on Rousseau's affectations and
contradictions, and said some things that diverted them. When I came
home I put them into a letter, and showed it next day to Helvetius, and
the Duke de Nivernois, who were so pleased with it, that, after telling
me some faults in the language, which you may be sure there were, they
encouraged me to let it be seen. As you know I willingly laugh at
mountebanks, political or literary, let their talents be ever so great,
I was not averse. The copies have spread like wildfire, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">et me voici à
la mode</i>. I expect the end of my reign, at the end of the week, with
great composure." (Ib. 118-119.)</p>

<p>One is tempted to give, as part of the whole picture of the visit of the
two Englishmen, a few of Walpole's notices of his own intense modesty.
Thus: "I had had my share of distresses in the morning, by going through
the operation of being presented to the royal family, down to the little
madame's pap dinner, and had behaved as sillily as you will easily
believe, hiding myself behind every mortal. The queen called me up to
her dressing-table, and seemed mightily disposed to gossip with me; but
instead of enjoying my glory like <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Sévigné</span>, I slunk back into
the crowd after a few questions. She told <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur de Guerchy</span> of it
afterwards, and that I had run away from her, but said she would have
her revenge at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fontainbleau</span>; so I must go thither, which I did not
intend." Ib. 81-82. So when writing to Gray, after giving a description
of the effect which his wicked wit had produced on Madame de Boufflers
and the Prince of Conti, how she "with a tone of sentiment, and the
accents of lamenting humanity, abused me heartily, and then complained
to myself with the utmost softness," and how he "acted contrition, but
had like to have spoiled all, by growing dreadfully tired of a second
lecture from the Prince of Conti, who had taken up the tale;" he
concludes, "but when I left a triumphant party in England, I did not
come hither to be at the head of a fashion. However, I have been sent
for about like an African prince or a learned canary bird; and was, in
particular, carried by force to the Princess of Talmond, the queen's
cousin, who lives in a charitable apartment in the Luxembourg, and was
sitting on a small bed hung with saints and Sobieskis, in a corner of
one of those vast chambers, by two blinking tapers." (Ib. 130-131.)</p>

<p>Hume's simple and self-satisfied account of the distinctions conferred
on him, and the gratification they afforded him, has met with
considerable ridicule. But the reader may judge for himself which is the
more honest, manly, and dignified: the plain acknowledgment of
distinctions conferred and appreciated, or this hollow profession of
contempt for unsolicited, unexpected, unenjoyed honours.</p>

afterwards an eminent statesman, was born in 1751. He was for some time
attached to the Fox party, and after the dissolution of the Fox and
North coalition ministry, he was twice unsuccessfully proposed as
Speaker. In 1793, he was selected for the delicate duty of negotiating
with the French Royalists. During the British sovereignty of Corsica, in
1794, he was appointed viceroy or governor of the island. But the most
brilliant and the best known chapter in his political career, is his
policy as Governor-general of India, from 1807 to 1814. He was created
Baron Minto in 1797, and Earl of Minto in 1813. He died in 1814.</p>

following criticism from Elliot.</p>

<p>"So you did not permit your friend to write the long intended letter.
Your reason for this, I must own, is not to me a satisfactory one. If
the secretaryship were now actually vacant, it would of course devolve
upon you; nor would the interposition of your friends be necessary. It
is Mr. Bunbury's provision then, and not yours, which constitutes the
difficulty: he happens to be in possession; his alliance and his
connexions are considerable; and the difficulty of his re-election makes
it less easy than it would otherwise be to find an equivalent for him.
Yet if it could be found, it is impossible to conceive that he would not
willingly exchange a situation, the functions of which are performed by
another, and which he holds contrary to the inclination of his
principal. In such a state of things, I cannot help thinking, that a
lively representation of your case, from the warm and persuasive pen of
your friend, is the most likely circumstance to engage the active genius
of the D. of B. to rouse government from their indolence about finding
or creating some proper arrangement for Mr. Bunbury. Lord Holland will
probably join his influence, and Lord Tavistock, even on his new
friend's account, will most certainly concur. This joint operation,
supported by the justice of your claims, and the application of your
friends, seems to me the most infallible method to surmount the real
difficulty, which you have candour enough to admit stands in the way of
administration, though disposed to do you justice. If to all this you
object certain delicacies in your own mind, and a disdain to solicit
what ought to be bestowed, I can only answer, a British minister is at
all times so much the slave of those who are not his friends, that his
best friends are almost always obliged to extort justice to themselves
by methods often hostile, always indelicate. I write to you popularly,
not as a philosopher. I desire, therefore, that your objections to my
doctrine may be in the same tone; and, after all, why should you, like
the plaintive author of 'Emile,' indulge yourself in a pleasing kind of
indignation, as if your countrymen had some unaccountable satisfaction
in mortifying a man, who feels so very different treatment even from
strangers. Notwithstanding all you say, we are both Englishmen; that is,
true British subjects, entitled to every emolument and advantage that
our happy constitution can bestow. Do not you speak and write and
publish what you please? and though attacking favourite and popular
opinions, are you not in the confidential friendship of Lord Hertford,
and intrusted with the most important national concerns? Am not I, a
member of Parliament, as much at liberty to abuse ministers and
administration, as if I had been born in Wapping, or to support them if
I think proper? Had it not been for the clamour of <em>a Scott</em>, perhaps
indeed I might have been in some more active, but not more honourable or
lucrative situation. This clamour we all know is merely artificial and
occasional. It will in time give way to some other, equally absurd and
ill-founded, when you, if you will, may become a bishop, and I a
minister. In the mean time, let us make the best of our present
circumstances; I as treasurer of the chamber, you as the idol of
whatever is fair and learned at Paris. About the beginning of December I
will be at London, ready to assist your operations if you will follow my
advice. Yours," &amp;c. MS. R.S.E.</p>

and has attempted to refute the foregoing narrative. He quotes a single
passage of the narrative, in which Mary is said simply to refuse
answering; and then a single passage from Goodall, in which she boasts
simply that she will answer; and he very civilly and almost directly,
calls the author a liar, on account of this pretended contradiction. The
whole inquiry, from beginning to end, is composed of such scandalous
artifices; and, from this instance, the reader may judge of the candour,
fair dealing, veracity, and good manners of the inquirer. There are,
indeed, three events in our history which may be regarded as the
touchstone of party men. An English Whig, who asserts the reality of the
Popish plot; an Irish Catholic, who denies the massacre in 1641: and a
Scotch Jacobite, who maintains the innocence of Queen Mary, must be
considered as men beyond the reach of argument or reason, and must be

<p class="section">Allusion has occasionally been made to the difficulty of satisfying Hume
with any amount of literary success. His correspondence with Millar is a
long grumble about the prejudices he has had to encounter, and their
influence on the circulation of his works; while the bookseller, by the
most glowing pictures of their popularity, is only able to elicit a
partial gleam of content. The success of the History made worthy Mr.
Millar very anxious that it should be continued, and Hume for a time
acquiesced in the proposal. There is a letter from Millar on the 26th
October, enlarging on the great and rapid sales: about 2500 complete
sets of the quarto edition, and upwards of 3000 of the "History of the
Stuarts," had been sold, along with <!-- Page 264 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_264" id="Page_v2_264">[264]</a></span>near 2000 of the 8vo. edition. In
continuation he says:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>The Essays, 8vo, were only published in May; what has been
sold of them, of all the different editions, I cannot
recollect. I was asked that question at St. James's the other
day, when I said, I considered your works as classics, that I
never numbered the editions, as I did in books we wished to
puff. This I said before many clergy. I am not a little
surprised to see one of your excellent understanding and merit
so anxious about the sale, when the booksellers entirely
concerned never complained, but on the contrary would be ready
to give you to your utmost wish any encouragement to proceed
in your History; and in truth, considering the number of
enemies, some particular Essays have risen from <em>interest</em>,
bigotry, folly, and knavery, not less than a one hundred
thousand, it is rather astonishing your works have sold so
much. While <em>men</em> are <em>men</em> this is to be expected, and you
are the last man I should ever thought could paid the least
attention to such things.<a name="FNanchor_264:1_219" id="FNanchor_264:1_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_264:1_219" class="fnanchor">[264:1]</a></p>

<p>On this Hume says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 14th January, 1765.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I am much obliged to you for your last letter,
which is very friendly, and I shall not fail to pay the proper
attention to it. The truth is, as I intend to continue my
History, I could not possibly have taken a more proper step
than to pay a visit to this country, and to make acquaintance
here; for as France and England are so intermixed in all
transactions since the Revolution, the history of one country
must throw light upon the other; and I am now in a situation
to have access to all the families which have papers relative
to public affairs transacted in the end of the last and
beginning of this century. The <!-- Page 265 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_265" id="Page_v2_265">[265]</a></span>reason why I was anxious to
know the sale of my History, was, that I might judge whether I
could expect equal access and information in England. The rage
and prejudice of parties frighten me; and above all, this rage
against the Scots, which is so dishonourable, and indeed so
infamous to the English nation. We hear that it increases
every day without the least appearance of provocation on our
part. It has frequently made me resolve never in my life to
set foot on English ground. I dread, if I should undertake a
more modern history, the impertinence and ill manners to which
it would expose me; and I was willing to know from you whether
former prejudices had so far subsided as to ensure me of a
good reception."<a name="FNanchor_265:1_220" id="FNanchor_265:1_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_265:1_220" class="fnanchor">[265:1]</a></p>

<p>The following very characteristic paper, which appears to have been
enclosed to Dr. Blair, needs no introduction.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p><!-- Page 266 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_266" id="Page_v2_266">[266]</a></span>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I am in debt to all my friends in letters, and
shall ever be so. But what strikes me chiefly with remorse,
are my great and enormous debts to the clergy. By this my
neglect of my Protestant pastors, you will begin to suspect
that I am turning Papist. But to acquit myself at once, allow
me to write you a common letter, and to address a few words to
every one of you.</p>


<p class="centersc">Dr. Robertson.</p>

<p>"Your History has been very very well translated here, better
than mine, as I am told. Its success has given me occasion to
promise your acquaintance to several persons of distinction;
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Nivernois, the Marquis de Puysieuls, President
Hénault, Baron D'Holbach</span>, &amp;c. I wish you could speak French
tolerably; you would find this place agreeable. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marechal
Broglio</span> spoke of you to me with esteem the other day.</p>


<p class="centersc">Dr. Carlyle.</p>

<p>"I consulted with the Chevalier Macdonald, (who, by the bye,
is here in great vogue, not for his gallantries, like some
others who shall be nameless, but for his parts and
knowledge;) I say I consulted with the Chevalier about writing
a common letter to Eglinton in favour of Wilson. He told me it
would be quite useless. Eglinton would give that kirk and
every thing else to the tenth cousin of the tenth cousin of a
voter in the shire of Ayr, rather than to the most intimate
friend he has in the world. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je baise les mains de Madame
Carlyle avec tout l'empressement possible.</span></p>


<p class="centersc">Dr. Ferguson.</p>

<p>"Who, by the bye, I believe is not a doctor, though <!-- Page 267 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_267" id="Page_v2_267">[267]</a></span>highly
worthy from his piety and learning to be one; then Mr.
Ferguson, I think I have nothing in particular to say to you,
except that I am glad of the change of your class, because you
desired it, and because it fitted Russell. For otherwise I
should have liked better the other science. The news of your
great success in teaching has reached me in Paris, and has
given me pleasure; but I fear for your health from all these
sudden and violent applications. Ah, that you could learn
something, dear Ferguson, of the courteous, and caressing, and
open manners of this country. I should not then have been to
learn for the first time, (as I did lately from General
Clark,) that you have not been altogether ungrateful to me,
and that you bear me some good will, and that you sometimes
regret my absence. Why should your method of living with me
have borne so little the appearance of those sentiments?</p>


<p class="centersc">Dr. Blair.</p>

<p>"Many people who read English have got your dissertation on
Fingal, which they admire extremely: a very good critic told
me lately that it was incomparably the best piece of criticism
in the English language; a self-evident truth to me. I met
also with many admirers of Fingal; but many also doubt of its
authenticity. The Chevalier Macdonald is of use to me in
supporting the argument, from his personal knowledge of facts.
I cannot, however, but allow that the whole is strange,
passing strange.</p>

<p>"You seem to wish that I should give you some general accounts
of this country. Shall I begin with the points in which it
most differs from England, viz., the general regard paid to
genius and learning; the universal and professed, though
decent, gallantry to <!-- Page 268 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_268" id="Page_v2_268">[268]</a></span>the fair sex; or the almost universal
contempt of all religion among both sexes, and among all ranks
of men? Or shall I mention the points in which the French
begin to concur with the English,&mdash;their love of liberty, for
instance? Or shall I give you some remarkable anecdotes of the
great men who, at present, adorn French literature? Perhaps
you would wish me to run over all these topics successively.
Alas! there is not one that would not fill several sheets of
paper with curious circumstances, and I am the most lazy
writer of letters in the world: however, I must say something
on these heads; and, first, of the first:&mdash;</p>

<p>"There is a very remarkable difference between London and
Paris; of which I gave warning to Helvétius, when he went over
lately to England, and of which he told me, on his return, he
was fully sensible. If a man have the misfortune, in the
former place, to attach himself to letters, even if he
succeeds, I know not with whom he is to live, nor how he is to
pass his time in a suitable society. The little company there
that is worth conversing with, are cold and unsociable; or are
warmed only by faction and cabal; so that a man who plays no
part in public affairs becomes altogether insignificant; and,
if he is not rich, he becomes even contemptible. Hence that
nation are relapsing fast into the deepest stupidity and
ignorance. But, in Paris, a man that distinguishes himself in
letters, meets immediately with regard and attention. I found,
immediately on my landing here, the effects of this
disposition. Lord Beauchamp told me that I must go instantly
with him to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchess de la Valieres</span>.<a name="FNanchor_268:1_221" id="FNanchor_268:1_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_268:1_221" class="fnanchor">[268:1]</a> When I excused
<!-- Page 269 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_269" id="Page_v2_269">[269]</a></span>myself, on account of dress, he told me that he had her
orders, though I were in boots. I accordingly went with him in
a travelling frock, where I saw a very fine lady reclining on
a sofa, who made me speeches and compliments without bounds.
The style of panegyric was then taken up by a fat gentleman,
whom I cast my eyes upon, and observed him to wear a star of
the richest diamonds;&mdash;it was the Duke of Orleans. The Duchess
told me she was engaged to sup in President Hénault's, but
that she would not part with me;&mdash;I must go along with her.
The good president received me with open arms; and told me,
among other fine things, that, a few days before, the Dauphin
said to him, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. Such instances of attention I found
very frequent, and even daily. You ask me, if they were not
very agreeable? I answer&mdash;no; neither in expectation,
possession, nor recollection. I left that fireside, where you
probably sit at present, with the greatest reluctance. After I
came to London, my uneasiness, as I heard more of the
prepossessions of the French nation in my favour, increased;
and nothing would have given me greater joy than any accident
that would have broke off my engagements. When I came to
Paris, I repented heartily of having entered, at my years, on
such a scene; and, as I found that Lord Hertford had
entertained a good opinion and good will for Andrew Stuart, I
spoke to Wedderburn, in order to contrive expedients for
substituting him in my place. Lord Hertford thought, for some
time, that I would lose all patience and would run away from
him. But the faculty of speaking French returned gradually to
me. I formed many acquaintance and some friendships. All the
learned seemed to conspire in showing me instances of regard.
The great ladies were not wanting to a man so highly <!-- Page 270 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_270" id="Page_v2_270">[270]</a></span>in
fashion: and, having now contracted the circle of my
acquaintance, I live tolerably at my ease. I have even
thoughts of settling at Paris for the rest of my life; but I
am sometimes frightened with the idea that it is not a scene
suited to the languor of old age. I then think of retiring to
a provincial town, or returning to Edinburgh, or &mdash;&mdash; but it
is not worth while to form projects about the matter.
D'Alembert and I talk very seriously of taking a journey to
Italy together; and, if Lord Hertford leave France soon, this
journey may probably have place.</p>

<p>"I began this letter about two months ago; but so monstrously
indolent am I that I have not had time to finish it. I believe
I had better send it off as it is. Tell Robertson that La
Chapelle, his translator, is very much out of humour, and with
reason, for never hearing from him. I suppose some letter has

<p>Mr. Elliot had expressed to Hume a fear lest the longer residence of his
sons in France might "render them too much Frenchmen," while, speaking
of their tutor, Mr. Liston,<a name="FNanchor_270:2_223" id="FNanchor_270:2_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_270:2_223" class="fnanchor">[270:2]</a> he says, "I own I am more
apprehensive of the consequences of a Paris life upon a young man of his
age than upon the boys, who are too young to enter into the full
dissipation of a country, where, not to be dissipated, is hardly to have
any existence." On this Hume writes:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have always had the pleasure <!-- Page 271 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_271" id="Page_v2_271">[271]</a></span>of conversing,
from time to time, with your sons, with Mr. Liston, and with
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Choquart</span>, and never found the least reason to alter
the good opinion, which I had at first conceived of that
academy, and of the conduct of every one concerned: but the
tenor of your last letter made me apprehend, that you had
discovered some ground of suspicion; and the more so as Mr.
Larpent told me, that you had spoke to his father, to desire
him to request of his son, that he should keep a watchful eye
over the conduct of your sons, and of Mr. Liston, and inform
him of all particulars. This it is impossible for Larpent to
do, and, indeed, impossible for me to do, otherwise than by
conversing with the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Choquart</span> and with your sons apart. I
have done this very carefully, and find Mr. Liston's conduct
not only irreproachable, but laudable. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> tells me, that
for the first three or four months, he scarce ever stirred out
of the house, but conversed with him alone, and with the other
masters, till he came to such perfection in the language, as
to be taken for a Languedocian, or a Frenchman of some
province. Since that time the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> tells me, he has made a few
acquaintances among his countrymen, and goes out sometimes;
but he uses this liberty with great moderation; and on the
whole, the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> praises him (and with great reason as appears
to me) for his reserve, his modesty, his good sense, his
sobriety, and his virtue. As to your sons, he assures me, that
though he has been employed nineteen years in instructing
youth, he never knew any more happily formed, and they are the
favourites of the whole school. The boys themselves seem to be
extremely happy in their present situation. Gilbert speaks
French almost like a Parisian, and Hugh follows fast after
him. This is an advantage <!-- Page 272 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_272" id="Page_v2_272">[272]</a></span>they have acquired, without
interrupting the course of their other studies. The
sociableness of their disposition has been called forth, by
living among companions in a public school; and as they praise
very much the civility and good humour of their fellow
students, they may themselves be the more confirmed in their
habits. But, pray, come hither yourself and judge of the
matter.</p>

<p>"Two or three days ago, Lord Hertford wrote a very earnest
letter to Mr. Grenville in my favour. I know well that, if you
find an opportunity, you will second his application. The
Saxon minister at the court, told my lord, that Mr. Wroughton
was soon to leave Dresden. My lord has proposed that Bunbury
be sent thither: if he refuses, it will be a proof that he is
resolved to undertake no public service, but scandalously to
live at home, and enjoy a large salary, which should belong to
another. Surely if Mr. Grenville bore me never so little
good-will, as a supposed Tory, he must allow this reasoning to
be unanswerable.</p>

<p>"You have now with you Sir James Macdonald, who is too good
for you, for I am afraid you will not know to value him. He
leaves an universal regret behind him at Paris, among all who
were acquainted with him, and in none more than myself. I am,
dear sir, your faithful humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_272:1_224" id="FNanchor_272:1_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_272:1_224" class="fnanchor">[272:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the following letter to Millar, we find Mallet and the Life of
Marlborough, that had been promised and paid for, again the subject of
speculation. Hume, though he had at one time been induced to believe
that part of the work was written, seems to <!-- Page 273 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_273" id="Page_v2_273">[273]</a></span>have on the whole indulged
himself in scepticism, which, in this case at least, was well founded.
The letter is dated 4th May.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As soon as I heard of poor Mallet's
death,<a name="FNanchor_273:1_225" id="FNanchor_273:1_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:1_225" class="fnanchor">[273:1]</a> my curiosity was excited to know, whether he had
really proceeded any length in his work, or whether, as many
people imagine, and as is somewhat my opinion, he had never
wrote a line nor taken a note with regard to it. I beg you
would make some inquiry upon that subject. The widow will be
able to inform you. I should be glad to know whether any
lights could be got from that quarter for the continuance of
my work."<a name="FNanchor_273:2_226" id="FNanchor_273:2_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_273:2_226" class="fnanchor">[273:2]</a></p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 12th May, 1765.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I went, on Wednesday last, to be present at the
examination of the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Choquart's</span> school, with which I was
very well satisfied; especially for the part your young folks
had in it. There were several people present who came to hear
their children and relations; and when Gilbert was going
through some demonstrations of geometry, with a very good
grace, I asked some who sat next me, whether they could
perceive him to be a foreigner? They all declared that they
could not; and were very much surprised when I told them that
he had not yet been in the country six months. Hugh retains
still a little of a foreign accent, but it is wearing out
gradually. Mr. Liston speaks so well as to be able to pass
himself for a Gascon!</p>

<p>"There was also one circumstance of your young gentlemen's
behaviour with which I was much pleased; <!-- Page 274 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_274" id="Page_v2_274">[274]</a></span>but whether you will
take the praise of it to yourself, or ascribe it partly to the
imitation of French manners, I cannot determine. I arrived a
little before the commencement of the examination; and,
walking into the garden, I took shelter, from the heat, under
some trees. Your young gentlemen, as soon as they saw me, ran
and brought me a chair, which they placed carefully in the
most shady spot they could find. I doubt this attention would
not be very common among mere English schoolboys.</p>

<p>"Lord Hertford has received, from George Grenville, a final
answer to a very earnest, and very pressing letter he had
wrote in my favour. Never was any refusal so decisive, so
cold, so positive, so determined; not the least circumstance
of apology, of good manners, or of regard: he even gives it as
a reason why I cannot be appointed, because Sir Charles
Bunbury has never yet desired to change his situation. In
short, the letter is so different from all letters usually
wrote on such occasions, and so different from those which Mr.
Grenville was accustomed to write to Lord Hertford, that my
lord concludes there is some particular reason of coldness,
though he cannot conjecture what it is. But there are also, in
the letter, some expressions which mark extreme animosity
against me. Lord Hertford thinks, they will admit of another
sense; and desires me to write to you, in order to ask whether
you have ever perceived such sentiments in that gentleman. I
know that I have affirmed, and, what is worse, have proved,
that Queen Elizabeth's maxims of government were full as
arbitrary as those of the Stuarts. I know that this
proposition, though now an undoubted and acknowledged truth,
is contrary to the principles of sound Whiggery. I know also,
that Mr. Grenville, <!-- Page 275 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_275" id="Page_v2_275">[275]</a></span>as a sound Whig, bore me no good will on
that account; but I did not really think that his quarrel
could have gone to such an extremity.<a name="FNanchor_275:1_227" id="FNanchor_275:1_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_275:1_227" class="fnanchor">[275:1]</a> You are sensible
of the consequences which I apprehended, and which you did
not, last summer, think so dangerous as I imagined. I have
now, for the first time, explained to my lord the nature of my
situation, which somewhat surprised him, being so contrary to
the assurances given him by Mr. Grenville: but he told me that
my interest was secure; for that he thought himself obliged to
make me reparation from his private fortune, for any breach of
faith which I might apprehend from the public. If this point
were fixed, it would probably stop the malignity of my
enemies, who will see that they can only do a small ill to
Lord Hertford, instead of a great one which they might intend
against me. However, my lord being desirous to know, from you,
Mr. Grenville's sentiments, as far as you can discover them, I
am engaged to enter into this detail, which otherwise I might
have desired to avoid. I am, with great sincerity, my dear
sir, your most obedient servant."<a name="FNanchor_275:2_228" id="FNanchor_275:2_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_275:2_228" class="fnanchor">[275:2]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 2d June, 1765.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;There is a gentleman here, an <!-- Page 276 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_276" id="Page_v2_276">[276]</a></span>Abbé, and a man
of letters, who is willing to enter into a commerce, or mutual
exchange with me, on every point of political and commercial
knowledge.<a name="FNanchor_276:1_229" id="FNanchor_276:1_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_276:1_229" class="fnanchor">[276:1]</a> He has a great deal of very exact
information, with regard to every thing that concerns these
subjects; has great freedom of thought and speech, and has no
connexions with any minister. As a sample, he has sent me the
enclosed questions, which I could not exactly answer, and is
willing to answer any of a like kind, which I could propose to
him. I thought I could not do better than transmit them to
you; and as I know you will also have questions to ask, I
shall <!-- Page 277 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_277" id="Page_v2_277">[277]</a></span>also transmit them to him, and you may depend on his
answer as just and solid. I have left the margin large enough,
to save you trouble. I know you are the most industrious and
the most indolent man of my acquaintance; the former in
business, the latter in ceremony. The present task I propose
to you is of the former kind.</p>

<p>"You will hear that Sir Charles Bunbury is appointed Secretary
for Ireland. Lord Hertford thinks it absolutely certain, that
I am to succeed him; and I, too, think it very probable. My
lord throws up immediately, if this demand is not complied
with; yet, notwithstanding these favourable circumstances, I
shall not be wonderfully surprised, in case of a
disappointment. I know that I can depend on your good offices
with Lord Halifax, and with every other person on whom you
have influence. Lord Hertford writes this post to that noble
lord. The present advantages I possess are so great, that it
seems almost extravagant to doubt of success; and yet, in
general, it appears to me almost incomprehensible how it
should happen, that I, a philosopher, a man of letters, nowise
a courtier, of the most independent spirit, who has given
offence to every sect and every party, that I, I say, such as
I have described myself, should obtain an employment of
dignity, and a thousand a-year. This event is in general so
strange, that I fancy, in the issue, it will not have place. I
am, dear sir, yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_277:1_230" id="FNanchor_277:1_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_277:1_230" class="fnanchor">[277:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Hume had come to the conclusion, and certainly justly, that as he
performed the functions of secretary of the embassy in France, he ought
to possess the rank <!-- Page 278 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_278" id="Page_v2_278">[278]</a></span>and emoluments of that office. He appears, however,
to have been reluctant to take any steps personally for the
accomplishment of this object; and his correspondence with his friends
shows that some urgency was necessary to overcome his scruples.<a name="FNanchor_278:1_231" id="FNanchor_278:1_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_278:1_231" class="fnanchor">[278:1]</a>
Having, however, finally decided on his course, he appears to have
pursued it with great energy and perseverance, and to have moved every
influence through which he was likely to accomplish his end.</p>

<p>On 24th June, 1765, Hume writes to his brother <!-- Page 279 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_279" id="Page_v2_279">[279]</a></span>that he "has now been
appointed secretary to the embassy, with the usual salary of £1200
a-year." He says, "The English ministry had intended not to appoint
another secretary of the embassy, who they knew could not be received,
but to suppress that office altogether from views of frugality." For the
continuance of the office, and its bestowal on himself, he seems to have
relied very much on the intervention of a foreign lady, his friend
Madame de Boufflers; and, strange as it may seem to find such an
influence effective in the councils of a British cabinet, he appears to
have been convinced that, had the matter not been previously settled in
his favour, her application would have brought it to a conclusion.
Continuing his letter to his brother, he says, "Nobody can do more
justice to the merit of my friend the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comtesse de Boufflers</span>, than the
Duke and Duchess of Bedford, who have indeed been essentially obliged to
her in their family concerns. She wrote the duke about a fortnight ago,
that the time was now come, and the only time that probably would ever
come, of his showing his friendship to her, by assisting me in my
applications; and she would rest on this sole circumstance all his
professions of regard to her. He received her letter while in the
country, but he wrote her back, that he would immediately hasten to
town, and if he had any credit with the king or ministry, her
solicitations should be complied with. He is not a man that ever makes
vain professions, nor does he ever take a refusal. He would find the
matter finished when he came to London; but it is a sensible pleasure to
me, that I owe so great an obligation, to a person whom I love and
esteem so sincerely as that lady."<a name="FNanchor_279:1_232" id="FNanchor_279:1_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_279:1_232" class="fnanchor">[279:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 280 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_280" id="Page_v2_280">[280]</a></span>In a letter to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marquise de Barbantane</span>, he gives the same account of
the matter.</p>

<p>"Have you heard of the share which <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span> had in this
event? As soon as she heard that there was a vacancy, by means of the
promotion of Sir Charles Bunbury, my predecessor, she wrote to the Duke
of Bedford, entreating him, in the most earnest terms, to befriend me in
my pretensions, and setting all my claims in the most favourable light.
The duke answered her, that he would soon be in London; and if he had
any credit or authority with the ministry, her friend should not fail of
success. The duke is not a man that ever promises in vain, nor is he a
man that is ever to be refused; so that, from this interest alone, I was
sure to have prevailed. But happily the same post brought intelligence
to the ambassador, that the affair was already finished. But do you not
think, that I owe the same obligations to our friend? or will you tell
me, that I seek only a pretence for indulging my inclinations?"<a name="FNanchor_280:1_233" id="FNanchor_280:1_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_280:1_233" class="fnanchor">[280:1]</a></p>

<p>The statement is repeated in the following letter to Elliot.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gilbert Elliot</span> <i>of Minto</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 3d June, 1765.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Not finding your young gentlemen in church last
Sunday, I went to see them, when I found them both confined to
the house with a light fever, which has since turned out the
measles in form, but with all the most favourable symptoms. I
find Mr. Liston very attentive and very careful; the young
gentlemen are attended by the physician of the academy. I use
the freedom to tell Lady Hertford the <!-- Page 281 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_281" id="Page_v2_281">[281]</a></span>way in which they are
governed; she tells me she would not act otherwise in the case
of her own children; so that Mrs. Murray,<a name="FNanchor_281:1_234" id="FNanchor_281:1_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_281:1_234" class="fnanchor">[281:1]</a> if you please
to communicate to her this intelligence, can have no reason
for anxiety. Gilbert has a greater quantity than Hugh, and
greater strength to bear them.</p>

<p>"You know, I suppose, that I am appointed secretary to the
embassy, though I have not yet received my credential letter:
the present confusions in the court may perhaps retard them
for some time; but Mr. Grenville has informed the ambassador
that the matter is concluded, and the king has given his
consent; so that in spite of Atheism and Deism, of Whiggism
and Toryism, of Scoticism and Philosophy, I am now possessed
of an office of credit, and of £1200 a-year: without
dedication or application, from the favour alone of a person,
whom I can perfectly love and respect. I find it has cost my
lord a very hard pull; and when I consider the matter alone,
without viewing the steps that led to it, I am sometimes
inclined to be surprised how it has happened.</p>

<p>"Shall I tell you another circumstance that is not
disagreeable to me; a certain lady, who is at present in
London, hearing there was some delay, wrote in the most
earnest terms to the Duke of Bedford, desiring his interest in
my favour; he answered her he would soon be in London, and if
he then possessed any credit or authority, she might depend
upon the success of her friend. You know that he is not a man
that makes vain professions, nor is he a man easy to be
refused. If you guess the lady, you will conclude that it will
not cost me a great effort to be grateful. The share you have
also been pleased to take is not <!-- Page 282 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_282" id="Page_v2_282">[282]</a></span>forgot, and strengthens our
ancient friendship. I am, my dear sir, yours
sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_282:1_235" id="FNanchor_282:1_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_282:1_235" class="fnanchor">[282:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It is probable that this appointment was impeded by more difficulties
than Hume himself could see, or his friends make him aware of. His being
a Scotsman of itself made it then unpopular, and in his case there were
other reasons likely to weigh with statesmen who looked in the direction
of popularity. We are told that "the printers of the <cite>London Evening
Post and Gazetteer</cite> , were called before the House of Lords, on a
complaint made by the Earl of Marchmont, for printing a letter (written
by Wilkes,) reflecting on the Earl of Hertford, ambassador at Paris, for
employing David Hume the historian as his secretary, and representing
the embassy as totally of Scotch complexion."<a name="FNanchor_282:2_236" id="FNanchor_282:2_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_282:2_236" class="fnanchor">[282:2]</a></p>

<p>No sooner had this appointment been completed, than Lord Hertford was
recalled, and Hume was left for a time <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chargé d'affaires</span> at Paris.</p>

<p>The ambassador had been appointed by Lord Bute, but had chiefly acted
during the administration of Grenville, with whom he and his connexions
were not, as Hume's correspondence has shown, on very friendly terms. In
July, 1765, the Rockingham administration was formed, in connexion with
which Lord Hertford became lord-lieutenant of Ireland, and his brother
secretary of state with the leadership of the House of Commons. Hume had
thus to perform the functions of British representative until the Duke
of Richmond arrived as ambassador in October. Of the <!-- Page 283 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_283" id="Page_v2_283">[283]</a></span>manner in which he
performed the duties of his office, Lord Brougham says:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>By Lord Aberdeen's kindness I have been allowed to examine the
correspondence of the embassy with Marshal Conway during these
four months; and it is highly creditable to the philosopher's
business-like talents, and his capacity for affairs. The
negotiations of which he had the sole conduct related to the
important and interesting discussions of Canada; matters
arising out of the cession by the peace of Paris; and to the
demolition of the works at Dunkirk, also stipulated by that
treaty. His despatches, some of them of great length, most of
them in his own hand, are clearly and ably written. The course
which he describes himself as pursuing with the very slippery
and evasive ministers against whom he had to contend,
particularly the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Praslin</span>, appears to have been marked
by firmness and temper, as well as by quickness and sagacity.
His memorials, of which two or three are given, show a perfect
familiarity with diplomatic modes and habits, and they are
both well written and ably reasoned. His information must have
been correct; for he obtained a knowledge of the secret
proceedings of the assembly of clergy, which, though convoked
for the purpose of obtaining the usual <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don gratuit</i>, chose to
enter upon the discussion of all the clerical grievances;
while they kept their deliberations carefully secret, and were
opposed by the parliament of Paris as soon as their
proceedings became known. Mr. Hume obtained a very early,
though somewhat exaggerated account of these things, through
two of the foreign ambassadors; and when he communicated it to
the Bishop of Senlis, he was treated with contempt, as if
nothing could be so wild, and as if some enemy of the church
had invented the fable to discredit her. Marshal Conway
appears by his despatches (which are also excellent) to have
rested his hopes of these differences passing off, on the
prevailing irreligious spirit in France, where "the Dauphin
alone," he says, "has any care for such matters; and he has of
late taken a military turn." In a short time the whole ferment
was allayed by the prudent and able conduct of Brienne,
Archbishop of Toulouse; the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">don gratuit</i> was voted; and the
assembly was prorogued to the following May. <!-- Page 284 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_284" id="Page_v2_284">[284]</a></span>Mr. Hume praises
Brienne very highly on this, as indeed he did on all
occasions.<a name="FNanchor_284:1_237" id="FNanchor_284:1_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_284:1_237" class="fnanchor">[284:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hume's familiar letters make us fully acquainted with the feelings he
experienced at this juncture.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to his Brother</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Compiègne, 14th July, 1765.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;There arrived yesterday a messenger from
England with my commission under the great seal. My
appointments, as I told you, are £1200 a-year. I have also
£300 for my equipage, and three hundred ounces of plate for my
table. This is the fair side of the picture. The misfortune
is, that General Conway, the ambassador's brother, is
secretary of state. The Duke of Grafton, his nephew,<a name="FNanchor_284:2_238" id="FNanchor_284:2_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_284:2_238" class="fnanchor">[284:2]</a> is
the other secretary. You still say, better and better. Not at
all. My Lord Hertford goes for England in a few days, and
leaves the burden of the embassy upon me. Still you say, where
is the harm of all this? You are come to years of discretion,
and can govern yourself. Wait a little, dear brother. Lord
Hertford goes lord-lieutenant to Ireland, and there is an end
of the ambassador, and probably of the secretary.</p>

<p>"It is true I can count upon Lord Hertford's friendship as
much as any man's in the world. One day last spring, he came
into my room, and told me that he heard of many people who
endeavoured by their caresses to persuade me that I ought to
remain in France. But he hoped that I would embrace no scheme
of life which would ever separate him and me. He now loved me
as much as ever he esteemed me, and wished we might pass our
lives together. He had resolved several times to have opened
his breast so far to me; but being a man of few words and no
<!-- Page 285 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_285" id="Page_v2_285">[285]</a></span>professions, he had still delayed it, and he now felt himself
much relieved by this declaration of his desires and
intentions. I know that Lord Hertford will not go to Ireland
unless he be allowed to name the secretary for that kingdom.
Perhaps he may think his son, Lord Beauchamp, too young for
that office; in which case I may very probably expect it, and
it is an office of between £3000 and £4000 a-year, and stands
next in dignity to all the great offices of the state. In all
cases the lord-lieutenant for Ireland has many and great
things to give, of which I should certainly expect one.</p>

<p>"Still you say, this is all better and better: Not at all! You
know the fluctuation of English politics. Perhaps, before you
receive this, the whole present system is overturned. Lord
Hertford, who, while he remained here, was a man of no party,
is involved with his friends. All is turned topsy-turvy: and
before next winter, perhaps, I am at your fireside without
office or employment! Here, indeed, I allow you to say, so
much the better; for I never had much ambition, I mean for
power and dignities, and I am heartily cured of the little I
had. I believe a fireside and a book the best things in the
world for my age and disposition. I write in some hurry,
therefore can only add, that if the old ministry return, I can
look upon the Duke of Bedford alone as my friend, by means of
the lady I mentioned to you. If the ministry stand, I have, by
Lord Hertford's means, many and great friends; and the king, I
have been well assured, honours me particularly with his good
opinion. In all cases it is a great point for me to have
obtained this commission to a place of so much trust and
credit and silences all objections against me, whether they
arose from religion or politics. <!-- Page 286 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_286" id="Page_v2_286">[286]</a></span>Direct your letters to me as
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Secrétaire d'Ambassade d'Angleterre à Paris</i>. I hate any
thing that disturbs so agreeable a settlement as I had
obtained before these great events. My compliments to Mrs.
Home and to Katy. Keep this letter to yourself, but write part
of it to our sister."<a name="FNanchor_286:1_239" id="FNanchor_286:1_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_286:1_239" class="fnanchor">[286:1]</a></p>

questions the other day, about him and his History. That
prince seems a reasonable man, but would be the better of

What does the doctor say at present to these great folding
doors opened to all the chimeras of ambition? Alas! they may
be thrown open much wider, if possible; none of these chimeras
will enter. Philosophy, with her severe brows, guards the
passage; while Indolence, in affright, is ready to throw
herself out at the window. Mr. Hume recommends himself to
Ferguson and Jardine, and John Adams and Mrs. Adams, and to

<p>Hume had now actually before him the prospect of filling the high office
of secretary to the lord-lieutenant of Ireland. Writing to his brother
on 4th August, 1765, he again states that Lord Hertford, before his
departure, had assured him that he would not accept of the
lord-lieutenancy, unless he were allowed the naming of the secretary;
and now adds, that the office is destined for himself, in conjunction
with Lord Hertford's son, Lord Beauchamp; and that his own salary is to
be about £2000 a-year. He continues:</p>

<p>"Thus you see a splendid fortune awaits me: Yet you cannot imagine with
what regret I leave this country. It is like stepping out of light into
darkness, to exchange Paris for Dublin. The most agreeable circumstance
is the friendship and confidence of the lord-lieutenant; and if the
present credit of that family continue, as it is likely to do, I shall
probably have it in my power to do service to my friends&mdash;particularly
to your young folks; for as to you and myself, it is long since we
thought our fortunes entirely made."<a name="FNanchor_287:1_242" id="FNanchor_287:1_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_287:1_242" class="fnanchor">[287:1]</a></p>

<p>He was not, however, destined to fill this office; and neither he
himself, nor his best friends, appear to have regretted the
circumstance; the fact being that he was but slenderly endowed with
either of the qualifications then indispensable to an Irish
statesman,&mdash;a capacity for hard drinking, and adroitness in bold
political intrigues. The exercise of an official function, among a
people where one sect of Christians enjoyed all offices, emoluments, and
honours, while another, following the national religion, were scarcely
allowed to live, must have shocked his sense of political justice;
<!-- Page 288 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_288" id="Page_v2_288">[288]</a></span>while it may be questioned if he was a sufficiently bold politician to
have attempted any reform of this abuse. The project of his appointment,
however, was brought so near its consummation, as to elicit certain
applications for ecclesiastical preferment, in order that the reputation
he had achieved, in other places, for influence in this department of
patronage, might not be unacknowledged in Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_288:1_243" id="FNanchor_288:1_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_288:1_243" class="fnanchor">[288:1]</a></p>

<p>In his letters to his friends, at this time, he describes these
vicissitudes of fortune; and indulges in a feeling to which he was very
prone,&mdash;an uncertainty as to his future projects, and an indolent
disinclination to make up his mind how to act.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Paris, 23d August, 1765.</p>

<p>"All the literati of my friends, who understand English, think
your Dissertation one of the finest performances in our
language. A gentleman, of my acquaintance, has translated it
for his own satisfaction. He could not publish it without
publishing "Ossian" at the same time. My scepticism extends no
farther, nor ever did, than with regard to the extreme
antiquity of those poems; and it is no more than scepticism.</p>

<p>"You may, perhaps, have heard of the rapid whirl <!-- Page 289 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_289" id="Page_v2_289">[289]</a></span>of my
fortune backwards and forwards of late. I had scarce received
my commission, as secretary to the embassy, when I knew that
that situation, the most agreeable in which I could have been
placed, was not to last. Lord Hertford must go to Ireland, and
resolved to carry me over as secretary to that kingdom, in
conjoint commission with his son. On his arrival at London, he
found the cry so loud against the promotion of Scotsmen, that
he was obliged to give it up; which he did the more easily, as
he knew my great reluctance to that office and scene of life.
He has now got a pension of £400 a-year settled on me; and as
he has prepared an apartment for me in the castle of Dublin, I
shall hurry thither as soon as I leave France, and shall be
afterwards free for the rest of my life.<a name="FNanchor_289:1_244" id="FNanchor_289:1_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_289:1_244" class="fnanchor">[289:1]</a> I have not
determined where I shall <!-- Page 290 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_290" id="Page_v2_290">[290]</a></span>pass my latter days. This place
should be the most agreeable to me; but a man who came late
thither, and who is not supported by family connexions, may,
perhaps, find himself misplaced, even in this centre of
letters and good society. I have a reluctance to think of
living among the factious barbarians of London; who will hate
me because I am a Scotsman, and am not a Whig, and despise me
because I am a man of letters. My attachment to Edinburgh
revives as I turn my face towards it."<a name="FNanchor_290:1_245" id="FNanchor_290:1_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_290:1_245" class="fnanchor">[290:1]</a></p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to his Brother</i>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I am now to inform you of another pretty rapid
change in my fortune. Lord Hertford, on his arrival in London,
found great difficulty of executing his intentions in my
favour. The cry is loud against the Scots; and the present
ministry are unwilling to support any of our countrymen, lest
they bear the reproach of being connected with Lord Bute. For
this reason, Lord Hertford departed <!-- Page 291 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_291" id="Page_v2_291">[291]</a></span>from his project; which
he did the more readily, as he knew I had a great reluctance
to the office of secretary for Ireland; which requires a
talent for speaking in public, to which I was never
accustomed. I must also have kept a kind of open house, and
have drunk and caroused with the Irish, a course of living to
which I am as little accustomed. The Duke of Bedford, to whom
I mentioned these objections, thought them very solid. I think
myself, at present, much better provided for, by a pension of
£400 a-year for life, which Lord Hertford has procured me. He
also writes me, that an apartment is fitting up for me in the
castle of Dublin. I shall go thither as soon as I can leave
France; which will not be till the end of October or beginning
of November, on the arrival of the Duke of Richmond.
Meanwhile, I am <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chargé des affaires d'Angleterre à la cour de
France</i>, which is the title under which you must write to me,
if you favour me with a letter.</p>

<p>"Lord Hertford had another additional project for my
advantage, in Ireland. The keeper of the black rod is a very
genteel office, which yields about £900 during the session. He
proposed, as I cannot be present on the opening of the
parliament, to give that office to another, who would
officiate, and would be content with £300. But I declined this
offer; not as unjust, but as savouring of greediness and
rapacity.<a name="FNanchor_291:1_246" id="FNanchor_291:1_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_291:1_246" class="fnanchor">[291:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 292 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_292" id="Page_v2_292">[292]</a></span>"Please to write all these particulars to Katty, except the
last, and seal and send her the enclosed. I am charmed with
the accounts I hear of Josey, from all hands. Yours sincerely.</p>

<p>"There was a kind of fray in London, as I am told, upon Lord
Hertford's declaring his intentions in my favour. The Princess
Amelia said, that she thought the affair might be easily
accommodated: why may not Lord Hertford give a bishopric to
Mr. Hume?"<a name="FNanchor_292:1_247" id="FNanchor_292:1_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_292:1_247" class="fnanchor">[292:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Writing an account of these transactions to Smith, in nearly the same
words, on 5th November, he commences his letter with the observation, "I
have been whirled about lately in a strange manner; but, besides that
none of the revolutions have ever threatened me much, or been able to
give me a moment's anxiety, all has ended very happily, and to my mind."
He concludes thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"As a new vexation to temper my good fortune, I am much in
perplexity about fixing the place of my future abode for life.
Paris is the most agreeable town in Europe, and suits me best;
but it is a foreign country. London is the capital of my own
country; but it never pleased me much. Letters are there held
in no honour: Scotsmen are hated: superstition and ignorance
gain ground daily. Edinburgh has many objections, and many
allurements. My present mind, this forenoon, the 5th of
September, is to return to France. I am much pressed here to
accept <!-- Page 293 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_293" id="Page_v2_293">[293]</a></span>of offers, which would contribute to my agreeable
living; but might encroach on my independence, by making me
enter into engagements with princes, and great lords, and
ladies. Pray give me your judgment.</p>

<p>"I regret much I shall not see you. I have been looking for
you every day these three months. Your satisfaction in your
pupil gives me equal satisfaction."<a name="FNanchor_293:1_248" id="FNanchor_293:1_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_293:1_248" class="fnanchor">[293:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>He writes to Blair, on 28th December:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;After great wavering and uncertainty, between
Paris and Edinburgh, (for I never allowed London to enter into
the question,) I have, at last, fixed my resolution to remain
some time longer in Paris. Perhaps I may take a trip to Rome
next autumn. Had I returned to Edinburgh, I was sensible that
I shut myself up, in a manner, for life; and I imagine that I
am, even yet, too young and healthy, and in too good spirits,
to come to that determination. If you please, therefore, you
may continue in my house, which I am glad pleases you. If you
leave it, as you thought you would, Nairne may have it for
£35, as we agreed."<a name="FNanchor_293:2_249" id="FNanchor_293:2_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_293:2_249" class="fnanchor">[293:2]</a></p>
</div>

<p>We have now to return to Jean Jacques Rousseau, whom we left, in 1762,
seeking protection from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Earl Marischal</span> at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neufchâtel</span>. He finally
took up his abode at <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Motiers Travers</span>, a village on one of the passes of
the Jura; where, now that some offensive associations connected with his
character and writings have died away, the fame of his genius still
lives, and has been no unprofitable commodity to the inhabitants. Here
he had a wild rocky district to wander <!-- Page 294 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_294" id="Page_v2_294">[294]</a></span>over, where he was not liable to
encounter those dangerous impediments which beset the sojourners in the
Alps. He had, at the same time, what was more to his purpose, a zealous
priesthood and an intolerant populace surrounding him. That the outward
manifestations of a morality, odious to his new neighbours, might not be
wanting, he sent for his celebrated mistress, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Thérèse la Vasseur</span>, with
whom he continued openly to live; and that the populace, thus
exasperated, might be under no mistake as to the proper person to throw
stones at, he adopted the garb of an Armenian.</p>

<p>It is much disputed whether he was really subjected to the attacks of
which he afterwards complained; and it is said, that whatever tangible
evidence of them was perceptible to other eyes than his own, was the
doing of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle la Vasseur</span>, to drive him from a neighbourhood
which she disliked. It will be found, however, that his story, as
reported by Hume in the letters which follow, substantially coincides
with the narrative in the "Confessions." This is in some measure a
testimony to the sincerity of Rousseau's own conviction, that those
hostile efforts were made against him; and indeed it would be useless to
question the sincerity of his belief in any thing indicative of the
malevolence of his fellow-beings. Having fled from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Motiers</span>, he lived for
some time on the island of St. Pierre, in the lake of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bienne</span>; and,
driven from that asylum, he seems to have hesitated between England and
Prussia as a place of refuge. He left the State of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bienne</span> at the date at
which his "Confessions" terminate, 29th October, 1765. He proceeded to
Strasburg, where, by wearing his Armenian dress in the country where he
had been proscribed, he certainly excited a considerable sensation. He
appears to <!-- Page 295 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_295" id="Page_v2_295">[295]</a></span>have held a sort of levée during his residence in that city,
where his daily and hourly proceedings have been recorded with the
precision of a court journal.<a name="FNanchor_295:1_250" id="FNanchor_295:1_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_295:1_250" class="fnanchor">[295:1]</a></p>

<p>It was here that he received Hume's letter, agreeing to aid him in
finding an asylum in England. The negotiation between them had been
brought to a conclusion by Madame de Verdelin, who had spent some time
with Rousseau at Motiers, and persuaded him to take advantage of the
impression which the Earl Marischal and Madame de Boufflers had made in
his favour.<a name="FNanchor_295:2_251" id="FNanchor_295:2_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_295:2_251" class="fnanchor">[295:2]</a></p>

<p>Hume's heart was farther softened by a letter, full of miseries, which
Rousseau had written to M. Clairaut. "I must own," says Hume, "I felt on
this occasion an emotion of pity, mixed with indignation, to think a man
of letters of such eminent merit, should be reduced, in spite of the
simplicity of his manner of living, to such extreme indigence; and <!-- Page 296 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_296" id="Page_v2_296">[296]</a></span>that
this unhappy state should be rendered more intolerable by sickness, by
the approach of old age, and the implacable rage of persecution." He was
inclined even to sympathize with Rousseau's petulant rejection of
proferred kindness; conceiving "that a noble pride, even though carried
to excess, merited some indulgence in a man of genius, who, borne up by
a sense of his own superiority, and a love of independence, should have
braved the storms of fortune and the insults of mankind."<a name="FNanchor_296:1_252" id="FNanchor_296:1_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_296:1_252" class="fnanchor">[296:1]</a></p>

<p>Leaving Strasburg, the wanderer proceeded to Paris, where he went about
in his Armenian dress; was mobbed and stared at to his heart's content,
wrote to his friends, complaining with bitter eloquence that people
would allow him neither solitude nor rest, shut himself up, and went
forth again to the world. Before he could have ventured to appear so
publicly, in the capital where a writ had been issued for the seizure of
his person, he must have received very strong assurances of protection.
The arrêt of the Parliament, however, was not recalled; and his friends
must have felt somewhat provoked by his pertinacious courtship of
popular notice, accompanied by the pretence of a desire to avoid it, by
adopting only what was simple and natural&mdash;by wearing, for instance, so
simple a dress as the fur cap, caaftan, and vest of an Armenian, in the
streets of Paris! Hume, who seems really to have had faith in his
modesty, must still have felt it awkward that the representative of
Britain should be closely allied with a person so conducting himself;
and was anxious, whenever the state of public business might permit him,
to see his charge safely across the Channel. It was thought, in the
meantime, expedient to find for Rousseau an asylum within the
<!-- Page 297 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_297" id="Page_v2_297">[297]</a></span>privileged area of the Temple, of which his friend, the Prince of
Conti, was Grand Prior. We must now allow Hume himself to describe his
new companion, and their intercourse.</p>

<p>In continuation of the letter to Blair, of 20th December, above cited,
he says:</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p>"I must, however, be in London very soon, in order to give an
account of my commission; to thank the King for his goodness
to me, and to settle the celebrated Rousseau, who has rejected
invitations from half of the kings and princes of Europe, in
order to put himself under my protection. He has been at Paris
about twelve days; and lives in an apartment prepared for him
by the Prince of Conti, which, he says, gives him uneasiness,
by reason of its magnificence. As he was outlawed by the
Parliament, it behoved him to have the King's passport, which
was at first offered him under a feigned name; but his friends
refused it, because they knew that he would not submit even to
that falsehood. You have heard that he was banished from
Neufchâtel by preachers, who excited the mob to stone him.</p>

<p>"He told me that a trap was laid for him, with as much art as
ever was employed against a fox or a polecat. In the
night-time a great enormous stone was suspended above the
door, in such a manner, that on opening it in the morning, the
stone must have fallen and have crushed him to death.<a name="FNanchor_297:1_253" id="FNanchor_297:1_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_297:1_253" class="fnanchor">[297:1]</a> A
man passing by early, perceived it, and called in to him at
<!-- Page 298 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_298" id="Page_v2_298">[298]</a></span>the window to be on his guard. He also told me, that last
spring, when he went about the mountains amusing himself with
botany, he came to a village at some distance from his own: a
woman met him, who, surprised at his Armenian dress&mdash;for he
wears, and is resolved to wear that habit during life&mdash;asked
him what he was, and what was his name. On hearing it she
exclaimed, 'Are you that impious rascal, Rousseau? Had I known
it, I should have waited for you at the end of the wood, with
a pistol, in order to blow out your brains.' He added, that
all the women in Switzerland were in the same disposition,
because the preachers had told them that he had wrote books to
prove that women had no souls. He then turned to Madame de
Boufflers, who was present, and said,&mdash;Is it not strange that
I, who have wrote so much to decry the morals and conduct of
the Parisian ladies, should yet be beloved by them; while the
Swiss women, whom I have so much extolled, would willingly cut
my throat? 'We are fond of you,' replied she, 'because we know
that, however you might rail, you are at bottom fond <em>of us</em>
to distraction. But the Swiss women hate you, because they are
conscious that they have not merit to deserve your attention.'</p>

<p>"On leaving <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neufchâtel</span>, he took shelter in a little island
about half a league in circumference, in the midst of a lake
near Berne. There lived in it only one German peasant, with
his wife and sister. The council of Berne, frightened for his
neighbourhood, on account of his democratic more than his
religious principles, ordered him immediately to withdraw from
their state. He wrote the letter of which I send you a copy,
as it is very curious. The council, in answer, reiterated
their orders for him to begone. He then applied to me. I have
made an agreement with a <!-- Page 299 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_299" id="Page_v2_299">[299]</a></span>French gardener in Fulham for
boarding him. We set out together in a few days.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to express or imagine the enthusiasm of this
nation in his favour. As I am supposed to have him in my
custody, all the world, especially the great ladies, tease me
to be introduced to him. I have had rouleaus thrust into my
hand, with earnest applications that I would prevail on him to
accept of them. I am persuaded that, were I to open here a
subscription with his consent, I should receive £50,000 in a
fortnight. The second day after his arrival, he slipped out
early in the morning to take a walk in the Luxembourg gardens.
The thing was known soon after. I am strongly solicited to
prevail on him to take another walk, and then to give warning
to my friends. Were the public to be informed, he could not
fail to have many thousand spectators. People may talk of
ancient Greece as they please; but no nation was ever so fond
of genius as this, and no person ever so much engaged their
attention as Rousseau. Voltaire and every body else are quite
eclipsed by him.</p>

<p>"I am sensible that my connexions with him add to my
importance at present. Even his maid <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La Vasseur</span>, who is very
homely and very awkward, is more talked of than the Princess
of Morocco or the Countess of Egmont, on account of her
fidelity and attachment towards him. His very dog, who is no
better than a collie, has a name and reputation in the world.
As to my intercourse with him, I find him mild, and gentle,
and modest, and good humoured; and he has more the behaviour
of a man of the world, than any of the learned here, except <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.
de Buffon</span>; who, in his figure, and air, and deportment,
answers your idea of a marechal of France, rather than that
<!-- Page 300 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_300" id="Page_v2_300">[300]</a></span>of a philosopher. M. Rousseau is of a small stature, and would
rather be ugly, had he not the finest physiognomy in the
world: I mean the most expressive countenance. His modesty
seems not to be good manners, but ignorance of his own
excellence. As he writes, and speaks, and acts, from the
impulse of genius, more than from the use of his ordinary
faculties, it is very likely that he forgets its force
whenever it is laid asleep. I am well assured that at times he
believes he has inspirations from an immediate communication
with the Divinity. He falls sometimes into ecstasies, which
retain him in the same posture for hours together. Does not
this example solve the difficulty of Socrates' genius, and of
his ecstasies? I think Rousseau in many things very much
resembles Socrates. The philosopher of Geneva seems only to
have more genius than he of Athens, who never wrote any thing,
and less sociableness and temper. Both of them were of very
amorous complexions; but a comparison in this particular,
turns out much to the advantage of my friend. I call him such,
for I hear, from all hands, that his judgment and affections
are as strongly biassed in my favour as mine are in his. I
shall much regret leaving him in England; but even if a pardon
could be procured for him here, he is resolved, as he tells
me, never to return; because he never will again be in the
power of any man. I wish he may live unmolested in England. I
dread the bigotry and barbarism which prevail there.</p>

<p>"When he came to Paris, he seemed resolved to stay till the
6th or 7th of next month. But at present the concourse about
him gives him so much uneasiness that he expresses the utmost
impatience to be gone. Many people here will have it that this
solitary humour is all affectation, in order to be more
<!-- Page 301 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_301" id="Page_v2_301">[301]</a></span>sought after; but I am sure that it is natural and
unsurmountable:<a name="FNanchor_301:1_254" id="FNanchor_301:1_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_301:1_254" class="fnanchor">[301:1]</a> I know that two very agreeable ladies
breaking in upon him, discomposed him so much that he was not
able to eat his dinner afterwards. He is short-sighted; and I
have often observed, that while he was conversing with me in
the utmost good-humour, (for he is naturally gay,) if he heard
the door open, <!-- Page 302 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_302" id="Page_v2_302">[302]</a></span>the greatest agony appeared on his
countenance, from the apprehension of a visit; and his
distress did not leave him, unless the person was a particular
friend. His Armenian dress is not affectation. He has had an
infirmity from his infancy, which makes breeches inconvenient
for him; and he told me, that when he was chased into the
mountains of Switzerland, he took up this new dress, as it
seemed indifferent what habit he there wore. I could fill a
volume with curious anecdotes regarding him, as I live in the
same society which he frequented while in Paris. But I must
not exhaust your patience. My kind compliments to Ferguson,
Robertson, and all the brethren. I am," &amp;c.</p>

<p class="datelineit">"Paris, 28th Dec. 1765."</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;Be not surprised that I am going to say in my
postscript, the direct contrary to what I said in my letter.
There are four days of interval between my writing the one and
the other; and on this subject of my future abode, I have not
these four months risen and gone to bed in the same mind. When
I meet with proofs of regard and affection from those I love
and esteem here, I swear to myself that I shall never quit
this place. An hour after, it occurs to me that I have then
for ever renounced my native country and all my ancient
friends, and I start with affright. I never yet left any place
but with regret: judge what it is natural for me to feel on
leaving Paris, and so many amiable people with whom I am
intimately connected, while it is in my power to pass my life
in the midst of them. Were I not indispensably obliged to go
to London, I know that it would be impossible for me to leave
this place. But it is very probable that being once there, and
fairly escaped from the cave of Circe, I may reconcile myself
again to the abode of <!-- Page 303 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_303" id="Page_v2_303">[303]</a></span>Ithaca. I left Edinburgh with great
reluctance. To return to it, after having tripled my revenue
in less than three years, can be no hardship. I must,
therefore, fairly warn you to remove from my house at
Whitsunday. I have taken a house at Paris; but I will have one
also in Edinburgh, and shall deliberate in London which of
them I shall occupy. I shall not go to Ireland. The arrival of
the Duke of Richmond was late; and this engagement with M.
Rousseau protracts my return so long, that it will not be
worth while to go to Dublin. Lord Hertford has been so good as
to excuse me. You have heard of the great fortune of Trail,
who is, I believe, your acquaintance, and a very honest
fellow. Nothing is so agreeable to an irresolute man, says the
Cardinal de Retz, as a measure which dispenses him from taking
an immediate resolution. I am exactly in the case. I hope your
resigning my house will be no hardship to you."<a name="FNanchor_303:1_255" id="FNanchor_303:1_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_303:1_255" class="fnanchor">[303:1]</a></p>

<p>Hume, Rousseau, and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. de Luze</span> of Geneva, a friend of the fugitive, left
France early in January 1766. We have no account of their arrival,
except Rousseau's statement in a letter to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Malesherbes</span>, that whenever he
set foot on the land of liberty, he leaped on his illustrious friend's
neck, embraced him without uttering a word, and covered his face with
kisses and tears; a ceremony with which Hume would probably have
dispensed, in the presence of "the barbarians who inhabit the banks of
the Thames." The first notice of their sojourn in Britain, is in a
bulletin by Hume to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>, dated London, 19th January,
1766. He says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>My companion is very amiable, always polite, gay often,
<!-- Page 304 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_304" id="Page_v2_304">[304]</a></span>commonly sociable. He does not know himself when he thinks he
is made for entire solitude. I exhorted him on the road to
write his memoirs. He told me, that he had already done it
with an intention of publishing them.</p>

<p>At present, says he, it may be affirmed, that nobody knows me
perfectly, any more than himself; but I shall describe myself
in such plain colours, that henceforth every one may boast
that he knows himself, and Jean Jacques Rousseau. I believe,
that he intends seriously to draw his own picture in its true
colours: but I believe, at the same time, that nobody knows
himself less. For instance, even with regard to his health, a
point in which few people can be mistaken, he is very
fanciful. He imagines himself very infirm. He is one of the
most robust men I have ever known. He passed ten hours in the
night-time, above deck, during the most severe weather, when
all the seamen were almost frozen to death, and he caught no
harm. He says that his infirmity always increases upon a
journey; yet was it almost imperceptible on the road from
Paris to London.</p>

<p>His wearing the Armenian dress is a pure whim; which, however,
he is resolved never to abandon. He has an excellent warm
heart; and, in conversation, kindles often to a degree of heat
which looks like inspiration. I love him much, and hope that I
have some share in his affections.</p>

<p>I find that we shall have many ways of settling him to his
satisfaction; and as he is learning the English very
fast,<a name="FNanchor_304:1_256" id="FNanchor_304:1_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_304:1_256" class="fnanchor">[304:1]</a> he will afterwards be able to choose for himself.
There is a gentleman of the name of Townsend, a man of four or
five thousand a-year, who lives very privately, within fifteen
miles of London, and is a great admirer of our philosopher, as
is also his wife. He has desired him to live with him, and
offers to take any board he pleases. M. Rousseau was <!-- Page 305 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_305" id="Page_v2_305">[305]</a></span>much
pleased with this proposal, and is inclined to accept of it.
The only difficulty is, that he insists positively on his
gouvernante's sitting at table,&mdash;a proposal which is not to be
made to Mr. and Mrs. Townsend.</p>

<p>This woman forms the chief encumbrance to his settlement. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.
de Luze</span>, our companion, says, that she passes for wicked and
quarrelsome, and tattling; and is thought to be the chief
cause of his quitting <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Neufchâtel</span>. He himself owns her to be so
dull, that she never knows in what year of the Lord she is,
nor in what month of the year, nor in what day of the month or
week; and that she can never learn the different value of the
pieces of money in any country. Yet she governs him as
absolutely as a nurse does a child. In her absence his dog has
acquired that ascendant. His affection for that creature is
beyond all expression or conception.</p>

<p>I have as yet scarce seen any body except Mr. Conway and Lady
Aylesbury.<a name="FNanchor_305:1_257" id="FNanchor_305:1_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_305:1_257" class="fnanchor">[305:1]</a> Both of them told me, they would visit Jean
Jacques, if I thought their company would not be disagreeable.
I encouraged them to show him that mark of distinction.<a name="FNanchor_305:2_258" id="FNanchor_305:2_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_305:2_258" class="fnanchor">[305:2]</a>
Here I must also tell you of a good action which I did; not
but that it is better to conceal our good <!-- Page 306 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_306" id="Page_v2_306">[306]</a></span>actions. But I
consider not my seeking <em>your</em> approbation as an effect of
vanity: your suffrage is to me something like the satisfaction
of my own conscience. While we were at Calais, I asked him
whether, in case the King of England thought proper to gratify
him with a pension, he would accept of it. I told him, that
the case was widely different from that of the King of
Prussia; and I endeavoured to point out to him the difference,
particularly in this circumstance, that a gratuity from the
King of England could never in the least endanger his
independence. He replied: "But would it not be using ill the
King of Prussia, to whom I have since been much obliged?
However, on this head (added he,) in case the offer be made
me, I shall consult my father;" meaning Lord Marischal.<a name="FNanchor_306:1_259" id="FNanchor_306:1_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:1_259" class="fnanchor">[306:1]</a>
I told this story to General Conway, who seemed to embrace
with zeal the notion of giving him a pension, as honourable
both to the king and nation. I shall suggest the same idea to
other men in power whom I may meet with, and I do not despair
of succeeding.</p>

<p>P. S.&mdash;Since I wrote the above, I have received your obliging
letter, directed to Calais. M. Rousseau says, the letter of
the King of Prussia is a forgery; and he suspects it to come
from M. de Voltaire.<a name="FNanchor_306:2_260" id="FNanchor_306:2_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_306:2_260" class="fnanchor">[306:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 307 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_307" id="Page_v2_307">[307]</a></span>The project of Mr. Townsend, to my great mortification, has
totally vanished, on account of Mademoiselle Le Vasseur. Send
all his letters under my cover.<a name="FNanchor_307:1_261" id="FNanchor_307:1_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_307:1_261" class="fnanchor">[307:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hume writes again on the 12th, to state that he has succeeded in
obtaining the promise of a pension from the king: "You know," he says,
"that our sovereign is extremely prudent and decent, and careful not to
give offence. For which reason, he requires that this act of generosity
may be an entire secret." He states, that this information must be kept
to herself and the Prince of Conti: and she in her answer, admires
Hume's generous and delicate conduct, and promises to keep the secret.
In his postscript Hume announces the important fact, that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle
le Vasseur</span> had arrived, and had found a companion to whom such a rag of
celebrity was no small acquisition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"P.S.&mdash;Since I wrote the above, I have seen General Conway,
who tells me that the king has spoke to him on the same
subject, and that the sum intended is a hundred pounds a-year:
a mighty accession to our friend's slender revenue.</p>

<p>"A letter has also come to me open from Guy the bookseller, by
which I learn that Mademoiselle sets out post, in company with
a friend of mine, a young gentleman, very good-humoured, very
agreeable&mdash;and very mad! He visited Rousseau in his mountains,
who gave him a recommendation to Paoli, the King of Corsica;
where this gentleman, whose name is Boswell, went last summer,
in search of adventures. <!-- Page 308 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_308" id="Page_v2_308">[308]</a></span>He has such a rage for literature,
that I dread some event fatal to our friend's honour. You
remember the story of Terentia, who was first married to
Cicero, then to Sallust, and at last, in her old age, married
a young nobleman, who imagined that she must possess some
secret, which would convey to him eloquence and
genius."<a name="FNanchor_308:1_262" id="FNanchor_308:1_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_308:1_262" class="fnanchor">[308:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Soon after, we find Hume writing as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to his Brother</i>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 2d February, 1766.</p>

<p>"As you know that I never left any place without regret, you
may imagine that I did not leave Paris altogether willingly,
after having been so long accustomed to it. I do not find this
new scene near so much to my taste; and I shall be long ere I
am reconciled to it. Perhaps Edinburgh may please me better; I
promise myself at least some satisfaction in my nephews, of
whom I hear a very good account; and it is surely more
suitable to one of my years to seek a retreat in my native
country, than to pass the dregs of life among the great, and
among people who, though they seem to have a friendship for
me, are still strangers. I accustom myself, therefore, to this
idea without reluctance; and since I have crossed the seas, I
find my regret for the good company I left behind me, less
pungent and uneasy.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>"You will have heard by this time, that I have brought over
with me the famous Rousseau, the most singular man, surely, in
the world. He applied to me last summer to take him under my
protection in England, as he called it; but in the meanwhile,
he was chased out of Switzerland, and came to Strasburg, <!-- Page 309 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_309" id="Page_v2_309">[309]</a></span>with
an intention of going to the King of Prussia, who pressed him
earnestly to live with him. At Strasburg my letter reached
him, making him an offer of all my services; upon which he
turned short, and having obtained the King of France's
passport, came and joined me at Paris. I have lived with him
ever since. He is a very modest, mild, well-bred,
gentle-spirited, and warm-hearted man, as ever I knew in my
life. He is also to appearance very sociable. I never saw a
man who seems better calculated for good company, nor who
seems to take more pleasure in it. Yet is he absolutely
determined to retire and board himself in a farmer's house
among the mountains of Wales, for the sake of solitude. He has
refused a pension from the King of Prussia, and presents from
hundreds. I have been offered great sums for him, if I could
have prevailed on him to accept of them. Yet, till within
these three months, he was in absolute beggary. He has now
about £70 a-year?<a name="FNanchor_309:1_263" id="FNanchor_309:1_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:1_263" class="fnanchor">[309:1]</a> which he has acquired by a bargain
for his works. It is incredible the enthusiasm for him in
Paris, and the curiosity in London. I prevailed on him to go
to the play-house in order to see Garrick, who placed him in a
box opposite the king and queen. I observed their majesties to
look at him more than at the players.<a name="FNanchor_309:2_264" id="FNanchor_309:2_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_309:2_264" class="fnanchor">[309:2]</a> I should desire
no better fortune than to have the <!-- Page 310 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_310" id="Page_v2_310">[310]</a></span>privilege of showing him
to all I please. The hereditary prince paid him a visit a few
days ago; and I imagine the Duke of York called on him one
evening when he was abroad. I love him much, and shall
separate from him with much regret."<a name="FNanchor_310:1_265" id="FNanchor_310:1_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:1_265" class="fnanchor">[310:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Hume writes to Dr. Blair on 11th February:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have seen in the newspapers enow of particulars concerning my
pupil, who has now left me and retired to Chiswick. He is impatient to
get into the mountains of Wales. He is a very agreeable amiable man, but
a great humorist.<a name="FNanchor_310:2_266" id="FNanchor_310:2_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:2_266" class="fnanchor">[310:2]</a> The philosophers of Paris foretold to me that I
could not conduct him to Calais without a quarrel; but I think I could
live with him all my life in mutual friendship and esteem. I am very
sorry that the matter is not likely to be put to a trial! I believe one
great source of our concord is, that neither he nor I are disputatious,
which is not the case with any of them. They are also displeased with
him because they think he overabounds in religion; and it is indeed
remarkable, that the philosopher of this age who has been most
persecuted, is by far the most devout. I do not comprehend such
philosophers as are invested with the sacerdotal character. I am, dear
doctor, yours <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">usque ad aras</i>."<a name="FNanchor_310:3_267" id="FNanchor_310:3_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_310:3_267" class="fnanchor">[310:3]</a></p>

<p>The first attempt to find a settlement for Rousseau, <!-- Page 311 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_311" id="Page_v2_311">[311]</a></span>was with the
French gardener at Fulham, already alluded to. The arrangement proposed
by Hume was, that the gardener was to receive from fifty to sixty pounds
a-year, as the consideration for boarding Rousseau and Mademoiselle, but
that he was only to draw twenty-five pounds from Rousseau, from whom he
was to keep the arrangement secret.<a name="FNanchor_311:1_268" id="FNanchor_311:1_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_311:1_268" class="fnanchor">[311:1]</a> Rousseau rejected this
arrangement with disgust; and various other efforts to find him a
suitable home were equally <!-- Page 312 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_312" id="Page_v2_312">[312]</a></span>unsuccessful. Hume, who, as Rousseau himself
tells <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>, was more anxious about his welfare than he
was himself, appears to have spent week after week, in the vain pursuit
of a resting place for the wanderer&mdash;no sooner framing a hopeful scheme
than it was contemptuously rejected. It does not appear, however, that
the inquiries were conducted precisely in the sphere in which Rousseau
liked to act. It is clear that he had not come to Britain to negotiate
with farmers at Chiswick, or French gardeners at Fulham. He undoubtedly
expected much more distinguished titles to be mixed up with his
arrangements; and we find that it was not till a rich man's well kept
country mansion was put at his disposal, that he deigned to be for a
moment satisfied. A letter to Blair, contains a very full narrative of
the subsequent proceedings.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.<a name="FNanchor_312:1_269" id="FNanchor_312:1_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_312:1_269" class="fnanchor">[312:1]</a></p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Lisle Street, Leicester Fields,<br />
<span style="padding-right: 1.75em;">25th March, 1766.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I had asked M. Rousseau the question you propose
to me: He answered, that the story of his <!-- Page 313 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_313" id="Page_v2_313">[313]</a></span>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Héloise</span>" had some
general and distant resemblance to reality; such as was
sufficient to warm his imagination and assist his invention:
but that all the chief circumstances were fictitious. I have
heard in France, that he had been employed to teach music to a
young lady, a boarder in a convent at Lyons; and that the
master and scholar fell mutually in love with each other; but
the affair was not attended with any consequences. I think
this work his masterpiece; though he himself told me, that he
valued most his <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Contrat Social</cite> ; which is as preposterous a
judgment as that of Milton, who preferred the Paradise
Regained to all his other performances.</p>

<p>This man, the most singular of all human beings, has at last
left me; and I have very little hopes of ever being able, for
the future, to enjoy much of his company, though he says, that
if I settle either in London or Edinburgh, he will take a
journey on foot every year to visit me. Mr. Davenport, a
gentleman of £5000 or £6000 a-year, in the north of England,
and a man of great humanity and of a good understanding, has
taken the charge of him. He has a house called Wooton, in the
Peake of Derby, situated amidst mountains and rocks and
streams and forests, which pleases the wild imagination and
solitary humour of Rousseau; and as the master seldom
inhabited it, and only kept there a plain table for some
servants, he offered me to give it up to my friend. I
accepted, on condition that he would take from him £30 a-year
of board for himself and his gouvernante, which he was so
good-natured as to agree to. Rousseau has about £80 a-year,
which he has acquired by contracts with his booksellers, and
by a liferent annuity of £25 a-year, which he accepted from
Lord Marischal. This is the only man who has yet been able to
make him accept of money.</p>

<p>He was desperately resolved to rush into this solitude,
notwithstanding all my remonstrances; and I foresee, that he
will be unhappy in that situation, as he has indeed been
always in all situations. He will be entirely without
occupation, <!-- Page 314 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_314" id="Page_v2_314">[314]</a></span>without company, and almost without amusement of
any kind. He has read very little during the course of his
life, and has now totally renounced all reading: He has seen
very little; and has no manner of curiosity to see or remark:
He has reflected, properly speaking, and studied very little;
and has not indeed much knowledge: He has only <em>felt</em>, during
the whole course of his life; and in this respect, his
sensibility rises to a pitch beyond what I have seen any
example of: but it still gives him a more acute feeling of
pain than of pleasure. He is like a man who were stript not
only of his clothes, but of his skin, and turned out in that
situation to combat with the rude and boisterous elements,
such as perpetually disturb this lower world. I shall give you
a remarkable instance of his turn of character in this
respect: It passed in my room, the evening before his
departure.</p>

<p>He had resolved to set out with his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gouvernante</span> in a
post-chaise; but Davenport, willing to cheat him and save him
some money, told him that he had found a retour chaise for the
place, which he might have for a trifle, and that luckily it
set out the very day in which Rousseau intended to depart. His
purpose was to hire a chaise, and make him believe this story.
He succeeded at first, but Rousseau afterwards ruminating on
the circumstances, began to entertain a suspicion of the
trick. He communicated his doubts to me, complaining that he
was treated like a child; that though he was poor, he chose
rather to conform himself to his circumstances, than live like
a beggar on alms; and that he was very unhappy in not speaking
the language familiarly, so as to guard himself against these
impositions. I told him that I was ignorant of the matter, and
knew nothing more of it, than I was told by Mr. Davenport, but
if he pleased I should make inquiry about it. "Never tell me
that," replied he, "if this be really a contrivance of
Davenport's, you are acquainted with it, and consenting to it;
and you could not possibly have done me a greater
displeasure." Upon which he sat down very sullen and silent;
and all my attempts were in vain to revive the conversation,
and to turn it on other subjects; he still answered me very
drily and coldly. At last, after passing near an hour in this
ill-humour, he rose up and took a turn about the room. But
<!-- Page 315 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_315" id="Page_v2_315">[315]</a></span>judge of my surprise, when he sat down suddenly on my knee,
threw his hands about my neck, kissed me with the greatest
warmth, and bedewing all my face with tears, exclaimed, "Is it
possible you can ever forgive me, my dear friend? After all
the testimonies of affection I have received from you, I
reward you at last with this folly and ill behaviour: but I
have notwithstanding a heart worthy of your friendship; I love
you, I esteem you, and not an instance of your kindness is
thrown away upon me." I hope you have not so bad an opinion of
me as to think I was not melted on this occasion; I assure you
I kissed him and embraced him twenty times, with a plentiful
effusion of tears. I think no scene of my life was ever more
affecting.<a name="FNanchor_315:1_270" id="FNanchor_315:1_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_315:1_270" class="fnanchor">[315:1]</a></p>

<p>I now understand perfectly his aversion to company; which
appears so surprising in a man well qualified for the
entertainment of company, and which the greater part of the
world takes for affectation. He has frequent and long fits of
the spleen, from the state of his mind or body, call it which
you please; and from his extreme sensibility of temper, during
that disposition, company is a torment to him. When his
spirits and health and good humour return, his fancy affords
him so much and such agreeable occupation, that to call him
off from it gives him uneasiness; and even the writing of
books, he tells me, as it limits and restrains his fancy to
one subject, is not an agreeable entertainment. He never will
write any more; and never should have wrote at all, could he
have slept a-nights. But he lies awake commonly; and to keep
himself from tiring, he usually composed something, which he
wrote down when he arose. He assures me, that he composes very
slowly, and with great labour and difficulty.</p>

<p>He is naturally very modest, and even ignorant of his own
superiority. His fire, which frequently rises in conversation,
is gentle and temperate; he is never in the least arrogant and
domineering, and is, indeed, one of the best bred men I ever
knew. I shall give you such an instance of his modesty as must
necessarily be sincere. When we were on the road, <!-- Page 316 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_316" id="Page_v2_316">[316]</a></span>I
recommended to him the learning of English, without which, I
told him, he would never enjoy entire liberty, nor be fully
independent, and at his own disposal. He was sensible I was in
the right, and said, that he heard there were two English
translations of his "Emile, or Treatise on Education;" he
would get them as soon as he arrived in London; and as he knew
the subject, he would have no other trouble, than to learn or
guess the words: this would save him some pains in consulting
the dictionary; and as he improved, it would amuse him to
compare the translations and judge which was the best.
Accordingly, soon after our arrival, I procured him the books,
but he returned them in a few days, saying that they could be
of no use to him. "What is the matter?" replied I. "I cannot
endure them," said he, "they are my own work; and ever since I
delivered my books to the press, I never could open them, or
read a page of them without disgust." "That is strange," said
I, "I wonder the good reception they have met with from the
world has not put you more in conceit with them." "Why," said
he, "if I were to count suffrages, there are perhaps more
against them than for them." "But," rejoined I, "it is
impossible but the style, and eloquence, and ornaments must
please you." "To tell the truth," said he, "I am not
displeased with myself in that particular: but I still dread,
that my writings are good for nothing at the bottom, and that
all my theories are full of extravagance. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je crains toujours
que je pèche par le fond, et que tous mes systèmes ne sont que
des extravagances.</span>" You see that this is judging of himself
with the utmost severity, and censuring his writings on the
side where they are most exposed to criticism. No feigned
modesty is ever capable of this courage. I never heard &mdash;&mdash;
reproach himself with the &mdash;&mdash;: nobody ever heard you express
any remorse, for having put Ossian on the same footing with
Homer!</p>

<p>Have I tired you, or will you have any more anecdotes of this
singular personage? I think I hear you desire me to go on. He
attempted once to justify to me the moral of his New Heloisa,
which, he knew, was blamed, as instructing young people in the
art of gratifying their passions, under the cover of virtue,
and noble refined sentiments. "You <!-- Page 317 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_317" id="Page_v2_317">[317]</a></span>may observe," said he
"that my Julia is faithful to her husband's bed, though she is
seduced from her duty during her single state; but this last
circumstance can be of no consequence in France, where all the
young ladies are shut up in convents, and have it not in their
power to transgress: it might, indeed, have a bad effect in a
Protestant country." But notwithstanding this reflection, he
told me, that he has wrote a continuation of his "Emilius,"
which may soon be published. He there attempts to show the
effect of his plan of education, by representing Emilius in
all the most trying situations, and still extricating himself
with courage and virtue. Among the rest, he discovers that
Sophia, the amiable, the virtuous, the estimable Sophia, is
unfaithful to his bed, which fatal accident he bears with a
manly superior spirit. "In this work," added he, "I have
endeavoured to represent Sophia in such a light that she will
appear equally amiable, equally virtuous, and equally
estimable, as if she had no such frailty." "You take a
pleasure, I see," said I, "to combat with difficulties in all
your works." "Yes," said he, "I hate marvellous and
supernatural <em>events</em> in novels. The only thing that can give
pleasure in such performances is to place the personages in
situations difficult and singular." Thus, you see, nothing
remains for him but to write a book for the instruction of
widows! unless perhaps he imagines that they can learn their
lesson without instruction. Adieu, dear doctor; you say that
you sometimes read my letters to our common friends; but you
must read this only to the initiated.<a name="FNanchor_317:1_271" id="FNanchor_317:1_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_317:1_271" class="fnanchor">[317:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Almost the only other matter which appears conspicuously in Hume's
correspondence during his intercourse with Rousseau, is the death of a
dear friend, often mentioned in his previous letters&mdash;Dr. Jardine. He
was a man of strong judgment, and much sarcastic wit; but his articles
in <cite>The Edinburgh Review</cite>  of 1755, are almost the only specimens of his
ability which he has left to posterity. He was born <!-- Page 318 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_318" id="Page_v2_318">[318]</a></span>in Dumfries-shire
on 3d January, 1716, and he was minister of the Tron Church parish when
he died. The death was sudden; and Hume, overlooking the calamitous
consequences of such events to surviving relatives, and in harmony with
the opinions he had expressed on death in a still more appalling form,
seems to have considered its suddenness as fortunate. He thus writes to
Blair, on 5th June.</p>

<p>"I cannot begin my letter without lamenting most sincerely the death of
our friend Dr. Jardine. I do not aggravate it by the circumstance of its
being sudden, for that is very desirable. But surely we shall ever
regret the loss of a very pleasant companion, and of a very friendly
honest man. It makes a blank which you must all feel, and which I in
particular will sensibly feel, when I come amongst you. I need not ask
you whether the miscreants of the opposite party do not rejoice, for I
take it for granted they do."<a name="FNanchor_318:1_272" id="FNanchor_318:1_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_318:1_272" class="fnanchor">[318:1]</a></p>

prejudice is not against the Scots, but against Lord Bute; that matters
have now, however, been all put right, for "it is generally believed
that Mr. <em>Greenville</em> is a good manager of the finances, and in general
means well: as a proof of it, our stocks have been creeping up daily,
and it is now generally believed that 3 per cent will soon come to par
if affairs continue peaceable!" One possessed of better opportunities of
judging, and more capable of using them, joins in these anticipations of
success with which Grenville's disastrous career as a financier opened.
Elliot says, on 25th March, 1765: "To-morrow Mr. Grenville opens the
budget, as it is usually called, and I believe our revenue will appear
to be on a better footing than is usually believed. I hope we shall have
discharged as much debt without breach of faith as you have done in a
politer way. Not that I pretend to censure your method. You borrow at a
high interest during time of war, and it is understood you are to take
your own method in peace. Our mode of proceeding is the very reverse of
this.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Your negotiation with regard to the French prisoners you
must have heard, met with all the approbation it so well deserved." (MS.

American Revolution, Grenville is now generally ranked with statesmen of
despotic principles. He was, however, an avowed admirer of the
democratic portions of the constitution; and it was in truth his
ill-directed advocacy of popular rights, not an intentional departure
from his avowed principles, that made his administration so disastrous.
His zeal for the independent authority of Parliament, and for the
curtailment of the prerogatives of the Crown, induced him to struggle
for the exercise by parliament, in the colonies, of a power with which
the crown could not compete,&mdash;that of taxation.</p>

corresponded with Hume on these subjects. He was born in 1727, and died
in 1819. From his great age and the cheerful social habits of his latter
years, he was one of the few members of the school of the
Encyclopædiasts, whom men of the present generation have been accustomed
to meet in general society. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Morellet</span> possessed two distinct titles to
fame. He had written some grave and valuable books on political economy
and statistics; while in lighter literature, and in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame Geoffrin's</span>
circle, he enjoyed a high reputation for playful and pungent wit. His
friends likened him to Swift; but as he sought to avoid malice in his
sarcasms, and to make them subservient to good principles in morals and
religion, he might, in this part of his character, be more aptly
compared with Sydney Smith. He had a great partiality for Scottish
music; but it may be doubted if this taste was either created or
fostered by his intercourse with Hume. In his very amusing <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Memoires</span>, he
describes a dinner with a musical party near Plymouth, in the open air.
Some young ladies, with their father and mother, approached near enough
to hear the music. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> gallantly carried them a basket of cherries.

reluctance, and after many struggles, prevailed with yourself to
acquaint some of your friends that Lord Hertford means to desire that
government would be graciously pleased to bestow the character and
emoluments of the secretaryship upon the person who actually performs
the functions of it. At your time of life, with so much independency
about you, and so unlike all your former conduct, indeed I am not at all
surprised that it cost you near two pages of apology and explanation
before you would even intrust me with the secret. Were you less deep in
the study of human nature, and somewhat more an adept in the ways of
men, I am apt to think you would rather have filled your letter with
excuses for not having sooner made this application."</p>

<p>He goes on to state, that he has been exerting himself in the matter,
but that on all occasions he had found himself anticipated by Lord
Hertford. He continues:</p>

<p>"As to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ingrata patria ne ossa quidem habebis</i>, don't be at all uneasy.
Here I can speak more peremptorily; and notwithstanding all your errors,
mistakes, and heresies in religion, morals, and government, I undertake
you shall have at least Christian burial, and perhaps we may find for
you a niche in Westminster Abbey besides. Your Lockes, Newtons, and
Bacons had no great matter to boast of during their lives; and yet they
were the most orthodox of men; they required no godfather to answer for
them; while, on the other hand, did not Lord Hertford spread his
sevenfold shield over all your transgressions? Pray, what pretensions
have you, either in church or state; for you well know you have offended
both?"&mdash;MS. R.S.E.</p>

which he died. According to the ordinary French historians, he was at
the same time so completely subjected to the priestly influence of the
Molinists, as to justify the supposition, that the decay of his mind
kept pace with that of his body. Others give a totally different account
of him, and Walpole says, "To please his family, the prince went through
all the ceremonies of the church, but showed to his attendants after
they were over, how vain and ridiculous he thought them. Many
expressions he dropped in his last hours that spoke the freedom of his
opinions; and to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duc de Nivernois</span> he said, he was glad to leave

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;You will see, in the papers, that Barré is to be my
secretary; but it has no other foundation. If I had been at liberty, I
should have desired to continue with him whose abilities and ease in
business I have so long experienced; but the world will have it
otherwise, and it must be my son. He is popular in Ireland; and I am
invited, on all hands, to name him; at the same time that I am told the
great danger of indulging my own inclinations, that if I named you, with
the particular additional prejudice that prevails, at present, against
the Scotch, that I should condemn my own administration. I have,
therefore, made it the condition of my acceptance of the lieutenancy,
that you are immediately provided for in a manner less likely to subject
you to the inconvenience of party changes. I have explained, both to the
King and the ministers, how essential I thought it to my honour and ease
of mind; and it is resolved. I flatter myself I shall soon be able to
acquaint you, that I have been a good solicitor; and, as my private
friend, I beg leave to assure you that I shall always be most happy in
receiving you in Dublin, and every other part of the world, let the
prejudices and follies of mankind be what they will. I hope you will
consider me as your friend; and I will desire no other return for all
the services I may be able to do you, than such a portion of your time
as you can bestow upon me, consistently with your inclination. The Duke
of Richmond goes to France: I do not yet know upon what plan, having not
seen him. He is a pretty figure; is easy in his behaviour; and does not
want parts. I wish he may have temper, experience, and knowledge of men
for that place. I have talked to my brother, as it became a wellwisher
to peace, upon this occasion. You will receive, by the messenger which
carries this letter to France, an official one from my brother, drawn by
himself, by which you will be able to judge of his style. I need not add
any thing to it. Every thing which passed, in a very long conference we
had together with Guerchy, is fully stated in it; but, when you talk to
the Duke of Praslin upon it, you will, if you please, take an
opportunity of recommending from me, in a particular manner, the
indulgence required for the holders of the Canada bills. This point may
be essential to the good understanding between the two courts."&mdash;MS.

and the rest will be placed to your account, without interrupting the

"Emile." "So much the worse both for you and your son;" <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tant pis pour

satisfactory. Of all the theories to reconcile Rousseau's
contradictions,&mdash;to discover on what principle he preached up parental
care, and sent his own children to the foundling hospital, the best is
supplied by himself in a single sentence in the Heloise: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'on sait bien

suspicious; and in his kindness to his new companion, he took every
thing in sincerity. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C'est un des malheurs de ma vie</span>," says Rousseau,
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qu'avec un si grand désir d'être oublié, je sois contraint de parler de
moi sans cesse</span>;" but those who knew him better than Hume did at so early
a period of their intercourse, do not give him credit for desiring to be
either neglected or forgotten. Madame de Genlis professes to have been
much vexed and perplexed by having acted on a reliance similar to
Hume's. Rousseau had promised to accompany her to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Comédie Françoise</span>,
on the condition that they were to occupy a <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">loge grillée</i>. When they
entered, madame flew to shut the grating; Rousseau opposed her; he was
sure <em>she</em> would not like it to be closed, and he would be sufficiently
hidden, by sitting behind her. In the scuffle he was recognised; madame,
vexed and terrified, insisted that the grating should be closed; but he
was inexorable. The commencement of a popular piece soon relieved them
from notice, and when the eyes of the audience were averted from him,
Rousseau grew gloomy and rude. He afterwards professed himself deeply
offended at having been exhibited as a wild beast! <cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires</cite> , ii. 12.</p>

<p>The same lady gives a more pleasing instance of his characteristics at
that time, in describing her first introduction to him. A friend told
her, that her husband intended to play a trick on her: to employ the
celebrated mimic Preville, the Foote of the French stage, to personate
Rousseau at his table. The expected guest appeared. His dress and
appearance were so unlike other people's, yet so like what would have
been expected in Rousseau&mdash;his conversation was so brilliant&mdash;that it
certainly must be a piece of wonderful acting. Thoroughly at her ease,
she laughed, and talked, and sang the airs of the Devin du village. It
was Rousseau himself! and not accustomed, in this the full blaze of his
reputation, to be received with so much freedom, by a young and
accomplished woman, he pronounced her to be the most lively and
unaffected of her sex.</p>

François, n'a pas voulu me parler Anglois, de sorte que l'entrevue s'est

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je vous supplie, mon très cher patron, de vouloir bien
m'excuser auprès de Myladi Ailesbury et de Mr. Le Général
Conway. Je suis malade, et hors d'état de me présenter, et
Mademoiselle Le Vasseur, très bonne, et très estimable
personne, n'est point faite pour paroître dans les grandes
compagnies. Trouvez bon, mon très cher patron, que nous nous
en tenions au premier arrangement et que j'attende dans
l'après midi le carrosse que M. Davenport veut bien envoyer.
J'arrive suant et fatigué d'une longue promenade: c'est
pourquoi je ne prolonge pas ma lettre: vous m'avez si bien
acquis et je suis à vous de tant de manières que cela même ne
doit plus être dit. Je vous embrasse de toute la tendresse de
mon cœur.</p>

<p>Had Lady Aylesbury requested the honour of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle le Vasseur's</span>
company along with that of her keeper? Rousseau tells us what pleasure
it gave him to see <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame la Marechale de Luxembourg</span> embrace her in
public. But if any English lady of rank and character offered to extend
her hospitality to such a person, there could be no stronger evidence of
the general consent to suspend all social laws in favour of Rousseau.</p>

describe the letter. Hume in answer says, "I suppose, that by this time
you have learned it was Horace Walpole who wrote the Prussian letter you
mentioned to me. It is a strange inclination we have to be wits,
preferably to every thing else. He is a very worthy man; he esteems and
even admires Rousseau; yet he could not forbear, for the sake of a very
indifferent joke, the turning him into ridicule, and saying harsh things
against him. I am a little angry with him; and I hear you are a great
deal: but the matter ought to be treated only as a piece of
levity."&mdash;<cite>Private Correspondence</cite> , p. 130.</p>

his dog. 'You must leave him behind,' said I. 'But the first person,'
replied he, 'who opens the door, Sultan will run into the streets in
search of me, and will be lost.' 'You must then,' said I, 'lock him up
in your room, and put the key in your pocket.' This was accordingly
done: but as we went down stairs, the dog howled and made a noise; his
master turned back, and said he had not resolution to leave him in that
condition; but I caught him in my arms and told him, that Mrs. Garrick
had dismissed another company in order to make room for him; that the
King and Queen were expecting to see him; and without a better reason
than Sultan's impatience, it would be ridiculous to disappoint them.
Partly by these reasons, and partly by force, I engaged him to
proceed."&mdash;<cite>Private Correspondence</cite> , p. 144.</p>

wrote immediately to my friend Mr. John Stewart of Buckingham Street,
that I had an affair to communicate to him, of so secret and delicate
a nature, that I should not venture even to commit it to paper,
but that he might learn the particulars of Mr. Elliot.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Mr.
Stewart was to look out for some honest and discreet farmer in his
neighbourhood, who might be willing to lodge and board M. Rousseau and
his gouvernante.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. It was not long before Mr. Stewart wrote me
word he had found a situation, which he conceived might be agreeable,"
&amp;c.</p>

<p>In confirmation of this narrative, there is the following letter in the

alluded to in Hume's letters.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Mr. Elliot told me the affair you recommended
to him. Since his arrival I have tried every farmer in our
side of the country, and can find no proper place. Some have
not room, some hate foreigners, some don't chuse boarders, and
the major part of all are such beings as he could not live
with in any comfortable manner. There is an old Frenchman who
has been here since a child, and has a sort of a garden farm
at Fulham. To him I proposed the thing without mentioning
names, and to oblige me he will take such a boarder: but still
I could wish to find a place where he would be more agreeably
situated, for this man keeps only a single maid, eats very
plain, and his house is as dirty as a Frenchman's in France.
The farmer himself is about sixty years old, unmarried, a
cheerful honest creature, of a very obliging disposition.
Consider whether this will suit your purpose, or if I should
try in other counties. Adieu, my worthy good sir. Believe me
eternally, your devoted servant,</p>

<p>"I received both your letters; and am exceedingly indebted to you for
the many curious and entertaining anecdotes you gave me concerning
Rousseau. They bestowed upon me somewhat of the same importance which
you say your connexion with Rousseau himself bestowed upon you in Paris,
by having so much information to give my friends from you concerning so
extraordinary a personage. Your accounts pleased me the more, that they
coincided very much with the idea I had always formed of the
man&mdash;amiable but whimsical. Strong sensibilities joined with an oddly
arranged understanding. He is a proof of what I always thought to be a
possible mixture in human nature, one being a sceptic from the turn of
their mind, and yet an enthusiast from the turn of their heart; for this
I take to be his real character&mdash;a man floating betwixt doubts and
feelings&mdash;betwixt scepticism and enthusiasm: leaning more to the latter
than the former; his understanding strangely tinctured by both." He
desires Hume to ask Rousseau, whether the principal scenes in his

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p class="center">1766-1767. Æt. 55-56.</p>

<div class="chapdesc">

Rousseau's pension&mdash;Origin and rise of his excitement against
Hume&mdash;Proper method of viewing the dispute&mdash;Incidents
illustrative of Rousseau's state of mind&mdash;His charges against

</div>


<p class="section">The place where Rousseau found a retreat, was the mansion of Wooton in
Derbyshire, surrounded by scenery, not unlike that which he had left
behind him in the Jura. It was a late addition to the extensive
ancestral estates of its proprietor, Mr. Davenport of Davenport. How
successful Hume had been, in finding a man of generous, warm, kindly
nature, to be the protector of his exiled friend, some letters from Mr.
Davenport, printed in the course of this narrative will attest.<a name="FNanchor_319:1_273" id="FNanchor_319:1_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_319:1_273" class="fnanchor">[319:1]</a></p>

<p>That Rousseau might be induced to live in his house, it was necessary
that Mr. Davenport should agree to accept of a sum of money in the shape
of board, and he good-humouredly conceded to Hume, that the amount
should be fixed at £30 a-year. "If it be possible," says Hume, "for a
man to live without occupation, without books, without society, and
without sleep, he will not quit this wild and solitary place; where all
the circumstances which he ever <!-- Page 320 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_320" id="Page_v2_320">[320]</a></span>required, seem to concur for the
purpose of making him happy. But I dread the weakness and inquietude
natural to every man, and, above all, to a man of his character. I
should not be surprised that he had soon quitted this retreat."<a name="FNanchor_320:1_274" id="FNanchor_320:1_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:1_274" class="fnanchor">[320:1]</a>
It appears that Mr. Davenport intended, if Rousseau became attached to
Wooton, to leave him a life lease of the house.<a name="FNanchor_320:2_275" id="FNanchor_320:2_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:2_275" class="fnanchor">[320:2]</a></p>

<p>Rousseau reached Wooton about the middle of March. On the 22d he wrote
to his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cher Patron</em> Hume, informing him that his new place of residence
was in every way delightful; and that its charms were enhanced by the
reflection, that he owed all the happiness of his new position to his
dear friend.<a name="FNanchor_320:3_276" id="FNanchor_320:3_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:3_276" class="fnanchor">[320:3]</a> Doubtless Hume, who must now have been a little
tired of the caprices which had so constantly baffled his friendly
exertions, felt this acknowledgment to be very gratifying. On the 29th
he received a letter, still friendly and grateful, but not quite so
warm, in which Rousseau, while he complains of the inconvenience of not
being understood by the servants, congratulates himself on his ignorance
of the English language, as saving him from the annoyance of
communication with his neighbours.<a name="FNanchor_320:4_277" id="FNanchor_320:4_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_320:4_277" class="fnanchor">[320:4]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 321 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_321" id="Page_v2_321">[321]</a></span>While all seemed thus serene, dark thoughts were gathering in the
exile's mind: and if Hume, relieved of his troublesome duties, and
probably satisfied with his own conduct, had known the nicer tests of
the state of that variable and tempestuous temper, he might have
calculated, by some indications, that the storm was about to burst. The
letter of Horace Walpole had, for some time, been lying at the bottom of
Rousseau's mind, not forgotten, though hidden from view; and it seems to
have formed the nucleus round which his diseased imaginations gathered,
and put themselves into shape.<a name="FNanchor_321:1_278" id="FNanchor_321:1_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_321:1_278" class="fnanchor">[321:1]</a> On the 7th of April, Rousseau
<!-- Page 322 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_322" id="Page_v2_322">[322]</a></span>sent a letter to the editor of the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite> , in which it
had appeared, denouncing it as a forgery concocted in Paris, and saying
that it rent and afflicted his heart to say, that the impostor had his
accomplices in England. That it was not then, or for many weeks before,
that he first became acquainted with this <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">jeu <!-- Page 323 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_323" id="Page_v2_323">[323]</a></span>d'esprit</i>, is clear from
a letter to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>, of 18th January, in which he states,
that Hume had just informed him of its existence.<a name="FNanchor_323:1_279" id="FNanchor_323:1_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:1_279" class="fnanchor">[323:1]</a> He appears to
have then attributed it to Voltaire. He afterwards imputed it, with
great confidence, to D'Alembert; and the ultimate discovery, that it was
not written by any literary rival and conspirator, but by an English
gentleman partial to such wicked amusements, appears to have been the
most galling circumstance connected with it.</p>

<p>It seems to have been believed, by some of those who knew Rousseau's
character, that his brooding over Walpole's letter would have been
insufficient to cause the commotions that followed, without the
malicious assistance of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Le Vasseur</span>.<a name="FNanchor_323:2_280" id="FNanchor_323:2_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_323:2_280" class="fnanchor">[323:2]</a> This woman, who
seems to have possessed all the vices to which her sex is liable,
without one of its virtues,&mdash;who had just enough of intellect to assist
the cunning of her depraved heart,&mdash;is said to have had an influence
over the philosopher of education, of which it is certainly difficult to
credit the extent. It will be seen, in the letters of Mr. Davenport,
that she had a dispute with his venerable housekeeper, concerning a
kettle and cinders! What was the exact nature of the dispute, is now, it
may be feared, buried in eternal oblivion; and we are left to conjecture
whither an influential cause in a literary quarrel, which interested all
Europe, may possibly <!-- Page 324 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_324" id="Page_v2_324">[324]</a></span>have been a kettle and cinders. On the 12th of
May, Rousseau wrote to General Conway, acknowledging the king's goodness
in bestowing on him a pension; saying he thought himself armed against
all disasters, but that a new and unimagined one had arisen, which so
troubled his spirit, that he had not the necessary presence of mind to
decide on the conduct he ought to adopt as to the pension. He expressed,
at the same time, sorrow that he could not publicly acknowledge his
obligations. This appeared to Hume and Conway to be an intimation, that
the pension would not be accepted if it were to be secret.<a name="FNanchor_324:1_281" id="FNanchor_324:1_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_324:1_281" class="fnanchor">[324:1]</a></p>

<p>While his mind was thus blackening within, he preserved a cheerful
exterior; and Mr. Davenport wrote to Hume, on 14th May, from Wooton: "I
came on Friday, and had the satisfaction of finding M. Rousseau in
perfect health. He seems to like the place; amuses himself with walking
when the weather is fair; if raining, he plays upon the harpsichord and
<!-- Page 325 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_325" id="Page_v2_325">[325]</a></span>writes: is very sociable, and an excellent companion."<a name="FNanchor_325:1_282" id="FNanchor_325:1_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_325:1_282" class="fnanchor">[325:1]</a> There is
evidence, however, that he had entertained all his evil thoughts of Hume
at a much earlier period. His second letter to him, in the capacity of
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Patron</em>, is dated, as we have mentioned, 29th March. On the 31st
he wrote to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. D'Ivernois</span>, saying that he found Hume allied with his
most dangerous enemies, and if he were not a rascal, he himself would
owe him many reparations for unjust suspicions entertained of
him.<a name="FNanchor_325:2_283" id="FNanchor_325:2_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_325:2_283" class="fnanchor">[325:2]</a></p>

<p>Resolved to bring the matter of the pension to a conclusion, Hume wrote
to Rousseau thus:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Lisle Street, Leicester Fields,<br />
<span style="padding-right: 3em">June 16, 1766.</span></p>

<p>"As I have not received any answer from you, sir, I conclude
that you persevere in the resolution of refusing all marks of
his majesty's goodness, as long as they must remain a secret.
I have, therefore, applied to General Conway to have this
condition removed; and I have been so fortunate as to obtain
<!-- Page 326 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_326" id="Page_v2_326">[326]</a></span>his promise, that he would speak to the king for that
purpose. It will only be requisite, said he, that we know
previously from M. Rousseau, whether he would accept of a
pension publicly granted him, that his majesty may not be
exposed to a second refusal. He gave me authority to write to
you on the subject; and I beg to hear your resolution as soon
as possible. If you give your consent, which I earnestly
entreat you to do, I know that I can depend on the good
offices of the Duke of Richmond to second General Conway's
application; so that I have no doubt of success. I am, my dear
sir, yours, with great sincerity."<a name="FNanchor_326:1_284" id="FNanchor_326:1_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_326:1_284" class="fnanchor">[326:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>This brought on the first gust of the storm. On 23d June, Rousseau wrote
his celebrated letter, beginning with the observation, that his silence,
interpreted by Hume's conscience, must have convinced the latter that
the whole of his horrible designs were discovered. In this letter
nothing is more remarkable than the contrast between the frantic
bitterness of the language, and the elaborate neatness of the
penmanship, which, if handwriting conveyed a notion of character, would
represent a calm, contented mind, gratifying itself by the exercise of
the petty art of caligraphy. A fac-simile of the concluding paragraph is
given, that the reader may have an opportunity of marking this singular
contrast.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/326.jpg" width="800" height="568" alt="Paragraph of a letter by Rousseau" title="" />

<p>Hume, now thoroughly angry, wrote as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Rousseau</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"June 26, 1766.</p>

<p>"As I am conscious of having ever acted towards you the most
friendly part, of having always given <!-- Page 327 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_327" id="Page_v2_327">[327]</a></span>you the most tender
and the most active proofs of sincere affection, you may judge
of my extreme surprise on perusing your epistle. Such violent
accusations, confined altogether to generalities, it is as
impossible to answer, as it is impossible to comprehend them.
But affairs cannot, must not, remain on that footing. I shall
charitably suppose that some infamous calumniator has belied
me to you. But, in that case, it is your duty, and, I am
persuaded, it will be your inclination, to give me an
opportunity of detecting him, and of justifying myself; which
can only be done by your mentioning the particulars of which I
am accused. You say, that I myself know that I have been false
to you; but I say it loudly, and will say it to the whole
world, that I know the contrary; that I know my friendship
towards you has been unbounded and uninterrupted; and that
though I have given you instances of it, which have been
universally remarked both in France and England, the public as
yet are acquainted only with the smallest part of it. I
demand, that you name to me the man who dares assert the
contrary; and, above all, I demand, that he shall mention any
one particular in which I have been wanting to you. You owe
this to me; you owe it to yourself; you owe it to truth, and
honour, and justice, and to every thing deemed sacred among
men. As an innocent man&mdash;for I will not say, as your friend; I
will not say, as your benefactor; but I repeat it, as an
innocent man, I claim the privilege of proving my innocence,
and of refuting any scandalous falsehood which may have been
invented against me. Mr. Davenport, to whom I have sent a copy
of your letter, and who will read this before he delivers it,
will, I am confident, second my demand, and tell you that
nothing can be more equitable. <!-- Page 328 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_328" id="Page_v2_328">[328]</a></span>Happily I have preserved the
letter you wrote me after your arrival at Wooton; and you
there express, in the strongest terms, in terms indeed too
strong, your satisfaction in my poor endeavours to serve you.
The little epistolary intercourse, which afterwards passed
between us, has been all employed on my side to the most
friendly purposes. Tell me, then, what has since given you
offence. Tell me, of what I am accused. Tell me the man who
accuses me. Even after you have fulfilled all these conditions
to my satisfaction, and to that of Mr. Davenport, you will
still have great difficulty to justify your employing such
outrageous terms towards a man, with whom you have been so
intimately connected, and who was entitled, on many accounts,
to have been treated by you with more regard and decency.</p>

<p>"Mr. Davenport knows the whole transaction about your pension,
because I thought it necessary that the person who had
undertaken your settlement should be fully acquainted with
your circumstances; lest he should be tempted to perform
towards you concealed acts of generosity, which, if they
accidentally came to your knowledge, might give you some
grounds of offence. I am, sir," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_328:1_285" id="FNanchor_328:1_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_328:1_285" class="fnanchor">[328:1]</a></p>

<p>In here exhibiting a few of the prominent features of the quarrel
between Hume and Rousseau, there is no intention of entering on a
defence of Hume, or a full examination of the conduct of the parties.
Viewing it as a picturesque incident in literary history, the reader
will probably feel an interest in such new light as may be thrown upon
it on the present occasion; but, it is presumed that few who <!-- Page 329 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_329" id="Page_v2_329">[329]</a></span>have made
themselves acquainted with the material circumstances of the dispute, as
they have been already made known, will expect any thing to be said that
can alter their appreciation of the conduct of the parties. Where there
are personal disputes, there is no cause so hopelessly bad as to be
without partisans; and when no other motive comes into action, a feeling
of generosity towards one who seems to have forfeited the good opinion
of his kind, calls forth a few vindicators and supporters. It was
natural that Rousseau, a man of great genius, whose writings had
produced a prodigious influence on his age,&mdash;one who had shown, in many
instances, the outward manifestations of a kind unselfish disposition,
and who had discarded, with an air of magnanimous scorn, all the
grovelling ties that bind the human creature to the earth on which he
crawls,&mdash;should have champions and supporters in any dispute in which he
might be involved, be his conduct what it might. Thus he had a few
vindicators, chiefly of the female sex, while he lived: but gradually,
when feelings of personal sympathy had died away, the conduct of the
disputants ceased to be weighed against each other in the same scales.
People did not inquire which of them had acted more fairly and justly
than the other; but, putting Rousseau's conduct out of the question as a
criterion, they asked, whether that of Hume was kind and magnanimous
towards the unfortunate monomaniac?<a name="FNanchor_329:1_286" id="FNanchor_329:1_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_329:1_286" class="fnanchor">[329:1]</a> Although this view is plainly
<!-- Page 330 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_330" id="Page_v2_330">[330]</a></span>to be traced in the sentiments of those who have fugitively touched on
the dispute, it is to be gathered <!-- Page 331 --><span class="pagenum"><br /><a name="Page_v2_331" id="Page_v2_331">[331]</a></span>more from the general tone of their
remarks, than from any direct avowal of belief, that Rousseau was a
monomaniac.<a name="FNanchor_331:1_287" id="FNanchor_331:1_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_331:1_287" class="fnanchor">[331:1]</a> There is a majesty in genius, that makes us reluctant
thus to ally it with the debasement of the human intellect. Yet, too
often, some portion of the most brilliant mind is thus eclipsed, though
the brightness of what is clear prevents our seeing easily the blackened
spot. In Rousseau's case, there has been, perhaps, a disinclination to
admit the "plea of <!-- Page 332 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_332" id="Page_v2_332">[332]</a></span>insanity," on account of the wonderful practical
sagacity that accompanied his aberrations. Though apparently surveying
the world with a sick and careless eye, he occasionally penetrated into
the depths of the human heart, and marked its secrets, with an accuracy
that made the practised and systematic observer's survey seem but a
superficial glance. He had a mind at times eminently practical,<a name="FNanchor_332:1_288" id="FNanchor_332:1_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_332:1_288" class="fnanchor">[332:1]</a>
and suited to estimate men's conduct and character: and thus appearing
before the world, there has been much hesitation to pronounce, that the
sincerity of insanity accompanied all his vile charges against a man
whose heart could not have been for one moment visited by the atrocities
of which he is accused.</p>

<p>It is clear, that whatever had been Hume's conduct in the affair,
Rousseau's rage was a storm predestined to burst upon him. Its elements
were in the mind of "the self-torturing sophist," not in the conduct of
any other person; and whoever was the object nearest to his thoughts at
the moment, as being most associated with the circumstances in which he
was placed, had to stand the shock. In this view, Hume's conduct is no
more to be tested by that of Rousseau, than the keeper's by that of his
patient. We are thus rid of the unpleasant employment of comparing
things which cannot bear comparison; and of the sickening task of
enumerating instances of kindness, attachment, persevering good offices,
and charitable interpretations of conduct on the one side, met by black
ingratitude, contempt, and deadly injury on the other.</p>

<p>If we look for that over-excited propensity which may have caused this
mental disease, it appears, beyond <!-- Page 333 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_333" id="Page_v2_333">[333]</a></span>doubt, that it was vanity.<a name="FNanchor_333:1_289" id="FNanchor_333:1_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:1_289" class="fnanchor">[333:1]</a>
All Rousseau's avowed misfortunes are the calamities of celebrity. At
one time he is the victim of princes and prime ministers; at another, of
an assembled clergy; at another, of half the learned men of Europe. That
he is neglected and forgotten is never among his ostensible complaints;
though there is good reason to believe that it was at the bottom of his
most conspicuous fits of fury. The English people, though they were at
first somewhat curious about the remarkable stranger, did not incommode
themselves about him, and obstinately abstained from following him into
the wilderness. In his long letter of charges, he cannot help bitterly
remarking the apathy of the public; but he states it as an accusation
against Hume,<a name="FNanchor_333:2_290" id="FNanchor_333:2_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_333:2_290" class="fnanchor">[333:2]</a> whom he supposes to have said, like Flavius,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line i10">I'll about</div>
    <div class="line">And drive away the vulgar from the streets:</div>
    <div class="line">So do you too, where you perceive them thick.</div>
    <div class="line"><!-- Page 334 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_334" id="Page_v2_334">[334]</a></span>These growing feathers, pluck'd from Cæsar's wing,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>Had the solitudes of Wooton been peopled by multitudes anxious to catch
a passing glance of the "apostle of affliction," he would doubtless have
let loose his half-appeased discontent in some querulous letters about
the impossibility of his finding repose and solitude; but he would not
have courted such a conflict as he rushed into in the bitterness of his
solitude. Although his character stands without parallel in its own vast
proportions, it is not without abundance of exemplifications on a
smaller scale. There are few who have not, in their journey through
life, encountered one or more small Rousseaus, in men of ravenous and
insatiable vanity, who, unlike the ordinary good-natured vain men, are
perpetually rejecting the incense offered to their appetite, and
demanding some new form of worship. In these, as in the chimney-piece
models of celebrated statues, may we view the proportions of the great
self-tormenter's mind; and when it is found that the peculiarity is
generally accompanied with some observable amount of intellectual
acquirements, which place the individual a degree above those who
surround him, the resemblance is the more complete. Vanity being its
source, the shape assumed by his monomania was a dread of conspiracies
in all shapes; and he was as sincere a believer in their existence, as
any unfortunate inhabitant of bedlam has ever been in the creations of
his diseased mind.<a name="FNanchor_334:1_291" id="FNanchor_334:1_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_334:1_291" class="fnanchor">[334:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 335 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_335" id="Page_v2_335">[335]</a></span>Hume had difficulty in extracting an answer to his letter of 26th June;
and probably it would not have been opened without the intervention of
Mr. Davenport. It was one of Rousseau's whims for some time not to
receive any letters; he said they were one of the methods by which his
enemies had persecuted him. On his first arrival he was to open none but
those which passed through the hands of his <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cher Patron</em>;<a name="FNanchor_335:1_292" id="FNanchor_335:1_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_335:1_292" class="fnanchor">[335:1]</a> a
convenient arrangement, as it afterwards enabled him to accuse Hume of
tampering with his correspondence.</p>

<p>Two letters were received from Mr. Davenport, before Rousseau drew up
his charge.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Mr. Davenport</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Davenport, June 30, 1766.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The receipt of your two last gave me much
uneasiness, which was augmented by some letters received
yesterday from Rousseau, along with yours, directed for me at
Wooton. Surely there must have been some excessive great
mistakes. It appears to me a heap of confusion, of which I can
make neither head nor tail. His letter to you is perfectly
astonishing: never any thing was so furious; so&mdash;I <!-- Page 336 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_336" id="Page_v2_336">[336]</a></span>protest I
don't know what to call it! I long to see him: he certainly
will tell some reason or other that could induce him to write
in that manner. Till I have seen him I can give no sort of
answer to your queries, as he never spoke one syllable to me
about any difference at all. I can't, possibly, before
Saturday's post; as in this part of the country we have only
three days in a week to send letters to town. You desired me
to burn the duplicate after reading. That signifies nothing,
for I can send you the other which I received yesterday from
Wooton. Good God, he must be most excessively out of the way
about this pension! In short, I have not patience to add one
word more, till I hear what he can possibly have to say; and
then I'll immediately acquaint you.</p>

<p>I can't help being troubled at seeing your uneasiness, and
will with great pleasure do all in my power to assist in
freeing you from it; at least I'll do my best endeavours. I
am, your most obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="authorsc">R. Davenport.</p>
</div>
</div>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">6th July, 1766.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I went over to Wooton on Tuesday: had a long
conference with Mr. Rousseau on the subject of your last
letters; gave into his hands yours addressed to him, (which he
had not read before:) showed him those I received from you;
and in the most earnest manner insisted upon his giving you an
open answer to all your questions, which I told him you had
certainly a right to ask, and he could not have any pretence
whatever to refuse. His spirits seemed vastly fluttered.
However, he told me a long history of the whole affair. I
said, that as my knowledge of the French language was very
imperfect, I might easily misrepresent things, so begged him
to write down the whole matter. Before he began his discourse,
I could not help speaking a deal to him on the subject of the
pension, and expressed my astonishment at his even ever having
had the least thought of refusing the favours of the greatest
king in the world. To my infinite surprise, he directly
returned this answer, That he never had refused, or any thing
like it; spoke with the greatest respect and veneration of his
majesty, and with all sort of acknowledgments of gratitude to
General Conway, &amp;c. <!-- Page 337 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_337" id="Page_v2_337">[337]</a></span>You may well imagine my surprise
increased. He then began his story: but that I entirely leave
to his pen, as he has faithfully promised to perform. I am
really sorry for him; he's uneasy, frets perpetually, and
looks terribly. 'Tis almost impossible to conceive the oddness
of his extreme sensibility; so that I conclude, when he's
guilty of an error, his nerves are more in fault than his
heart. Things vex him to the utmost extent of vexation, which
would not even move such a dull soul as mine is. In short, I
perceive his disorder is jealousy: he thinks you are fond of
some <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savans hommes</i>, whom he unfortunately calls his enemies.
It will give me the greatest satisfaction to hear that you
have received a satisfactory answer, and that every thing is
set right again.<a name="FNanchor_337:1_293" id="FNanchor_337:1_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:1_293" class="fnanchor">[337:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>At last came the full outpouring of the long-treasured wrath, in a
letter dated the 10th of July, as long as an ordinary pamphlet, and
penned with the same neat precision as its predecessor. The reader will
not expect a document so well known and easily accessible to be
reprinted; and an abridgment would fail to give any notion of the rabid
eloquence with which the most paltry incidents are made to assume the
appearance of portentous charges; until, through vehemence of expression
and multitude of powerful words, they seem for the moment to acquire
substantial shape. Many of the charges contained in this "indictment"
have been already alluded to. The document begins with a statement of
its author's candour,<a name="FNanchor_337:2_294" id="FNanchor_337:2_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_337:2_294" class="fnanchor">[337:2]</a> and hatred of every kind of artifice; <!-- Page 338 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_338" id="Page_v2_338">[338]</a></span>and
no one can read the charges which follow, monstrously absurd as they
are, without seeing that they are made in the perfect sincerity of a
mind that saw all things through its own diseased medium. The following
is one of the substantive charges:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I was informed that the son of the quack Tronchin,<a name="FNanchor_338:1_295" id="FNanchor_338:1_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_338:1_295" class="fnanchor">[338:1]</a> my
most mortal enemy, was not only the friend of Mr. Hume, and
under his protection, but that they both lodged in the same
house; and when Mr. Hume found that I knew this, he imparted
it in confidence to me; assuring me that the son by no means
resembled the father. I lodged a few nights myself, together
with my governante, in the same house; and from the kind of
reception with which we were honoured by the landladies, who
are his friends, I judged in what manner either Mr. Hume, or
that man, who, as he said, was by no means like his father,
must have spoken to them both of her and me.</p>

<p>All these facts put together, added to a certain appearance of
things on the whole, insensibly gave me an uneasiness, which I
rejected with horror.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The description of the following scene must have been, to those who knew
Hume personally, irresistibly ludicrous. The picture of the phlegmatic
reserve of English manners, is made perfect by contrast. It appears from
Hume's letter, that the scene arose out of the dispute about the return
chaise.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p><!-- Page 339 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_339" id="Page_v2_339">[339]</a></span>One evening, after supper, as we were sitting silent by the
fireside, I caught his eyes intently fixed on me, as indeed
happened very often; and that in a manner of which it is very
difficult to give an idea. At that time he gave me a
steadfast, piercing look, mingled with a sneer, which greatly
disturbed me. To get rid of my embarrassment, I endeavoured to
look full at him in my turn; but, in fixing my eyes upon his,
I felt the most inexpressible terror, and was soon obliged to
turn them away. The speech and physiognomy of the good David
are those of an honest man; but where, great God! did this
honest man borrow those eyes which he fixes on his friends?</p>

<p>The impression of this look remained with me, and gave me much
uneasiness. My trouble increased even to a degree of fainting;
and if I had not been relieved by a flood of tears, I must
have been suffocated. Presently after this I was seized with
the most violent remorse: I even despised myself; till at
length, in a transport, which I still remember with delight, I
sprang on his neck, and embraced him eagerly; while, almost
choked with sobbing, and bathed in tears, I cried out, in
broken accents, "No, no, David Hume cannot be treacherous; if
he be not the best of men, he must be the basest." David Hume
politely returned my embraces, and gently tapping me on the
back, repeated several times, in a placid tone, "Why, what, my
dear sir! Nay, my dear sir! Oh, my dear sir!" He said nothing
more. I felt my heart yearn within me. We went to bed; and I
set out the next day for the country.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>There is another charge against Hume, of once muttering in his sleep the
words <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je tiens J. J. Rousseau</i>; which he did not deny, saying, that he
could not feel certain as to what he might or might not have done when
asleep, though he doubted if it was his practice to dream in
French.<a name="FNanchor_339:1_296" id="FNanchor_339:1_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_339:1_296" class="fnanchor">[339:1]</a> The proffered hospitalities and kindnesses of Hume are a
running charge throughout; wound up with the conclusion, that as he must
have seen that Rousseau was estranged <!-- Page 340 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_340" id="Page_v2_340">[340]</a></span>from him, "If he supposed that in
such circumstances I should have accepted his services, he must have
supposed me to have been an infamous scoundrel. It was then in behalf of
a man whom he supposed to be a scoundrel that he so warmly solicited a
pension from his majesty."<a name="FNanchor_340:1_297" id="FNanchor_340:1_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_340:1_297" class="fnanchor">[340:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 341 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_341" id="Page_v2_341">[341]</a></span>Hume's answer to this charge was as follows:</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Rousseau</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Lisle Street, Leicester Fields, July 22, 1766.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I shall only answer one article of your long letter: it
is that which regards the conversation we had the evening
<!-- Page 342 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_342" id="Page_v2_342">[342]</a></span>before your departure. Mr. Davenport had contrived a
good-natured artifice, to make you believe that a retour
chaise was ready to set out for Wooton; and I believe he
caused an advertisement be put in the papers, in order the
better to deceive you. His purpose only was to save you some
expenses in the journey, which I thought a laudable project;
though I had no hand either in contriving or conducting it.
You entertained, however, a suspicion of his design, while we
were sitting alone by my fireside; and you reproached me with
concurring in it. I endeavoured to pacify you, and to divert
the discourse; but to no purpose. You sat sullen, and was
either silent, or made me very peevish answers. At last you
rose up, and took a turn or two about the room, when all of a
sudden, and to my great surprise, you clapped yourself on my
knee, threw your arms about my neck, kissed me with seeming
ardour, and bedewed my face with tears. You exclaimed, "My
dear friend, can you ever pardon this folly? After all the
pains you have taken to serve me, after the numberless
instances of friendship you have given me, here I reward you
with this ill-humour and sullenness. But your forgiveness of
me will be a new instance of your friendship; and I hope you
will find at bottom, that my heart is not unworthy of it."</p>

<p>I was very much affected, I own; and I believe a very tender
scene passed between us. You added, by way of compliment no
doubt, that though I had many better titles to recommend me to
posterity, yet perhaps my uncommon attachment to a poor,
unhappy, and persecuted man, would not be altogether
overlooked.</p>

<p><!-- Page 343 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_343" id="Page_v2_343">[343]</a></span>This incident was somewhat remarkable; and it is impossible
that either you or I could so soon have forgot it. But you
have had the assurance to tell me the story twice, in a manner
so different, or rather so opposite, that when I persist, as I
do, in this account, it necessarily follows, that either you
are, or I am, a liar. You imagine, perhaps, that because the
incident passed privately without a witness, the question will
lie between the credibility of your assertion and of mine. But
you shall not have this advantage or disadvantage, whichever
you are pleased to term it. I shall produce against you other
proofs, which will put the matter beyond controversy.</p>

<p>First, You are not aware, that I have a letter under your
hand, which is tolerably irreconcilable with your account, and
confirms mine.<a name="FNanchor_343:1_298" id="FNanchor_343:1_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_343:1_298" class="fnanchor">[343:1]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, I told the story the next day, or the day after, to
Mr. Davenport, with a view of preventing any such good-natured
artifices for the future. He surely remembers it.</p>

<p>Thirdly, As I thought the story much to your honour, I told it
to several of my friends here. I even wrote it to Madame de
Boufflers at Paris. I believe no one will imagine that I was
preparing beforehand an apology, in case of a rupture with
you; which, of all human events, I should then have thought
the most incredible, especially as we were separated, almost
for ever, and I still continued to render you the most
essential services.</p>

<p>Fourthly, The story, as I tell it, is consistent and rational:
there is not common sense in your account. What! because
sometimes, when absent in thought, (a circumstance common
enough with men whose minds are intensely occupied,) I have a
fixed look or stare, you suspect me to be a traitor, and you
have the assurance to tell me of such black and ridiculous
suspicions! For you do not even pretend that before you left
London you had any other solid grounds of suspicion against
me.</p>

<p><!-- Page 344 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_344" id="Page_v2_344">[344]</a></span>I shall enter into no detail with regard to your letter: you
yourself well know that all the other articles of it are
without foundation. I shall only add in general, that I
enjoyed about a month ago an uncommon pleasure, in thinking
that, in spite of many difficulties, I had, by assiduity and
care, and even beyond my most sanguine expectations, provided
for your repose, honour, and fortune. But that pleasure was
soon imbittered, by finding that you had voluntarily and
wantonly thrown away all those advantages, and was become the
declared enemy of your own repose, fortune, and honour: I
cannot be surprised after this that you are my enemy. Adieu,
and for ever.<a name="FNanchor_344:1_299" id="FNanchor_344:1_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_344:1_299" class="fnanchor">[344:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hume did not profess to submit to these attacks with the meekness of the
dove, as a few letters to his friends will show. Of the two following
letters to Blair, the one was written before, the other after the
reception of Rousseau's "indictment."</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Lisle Street, 1st July, 1766.</p>

<p>"You will be surprised, dear Doctor, when I desire you most
earnestly never in your life to show to any mortal creature
the letters I wrote you with regard to Rousseau. He is surely
the blackest and most atrocious villain, beyond comparison,
that now exists in the world, and I am heartily ashamed of any
thing I ever wrote in his favour. I know you will pity me when
I tell you that I am afraid I must publish this to the world

<p class="letterdateit">"15th July, 1766.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;I go in a few hours to Woburn; so can only give
you the outline of my history. Through many difficulties I
obtained a pension for Rousseau. The application was made with
his own consent and knowledge. I write him, that all is
happily completed, and he need only draw for the money. He
answers me, that I am a rogue and a rascal; and have brought
him into England merely to dishonour him. I demand the reason
of this strange language; and Mr. Davenport, the gentleman
with whom he lives, tells him that he must necessarily satisfy
me. To-day I received a letter from him, which is perfect
frenzy. It would make a good eighteen-penny pamphlet; and I
fancy he intends to publish it. He there tells me, that
D'Alembert, Horace Walpole, and I, had, from the first,
entered into a combination to ruin him, and had ruined him.
That the first suspicion of my treachery arose in him while we
lay together in the same room of an inn in France. I there
spoke in my sleep, and betrayed my intention of ruining him.
That young Tronchin lodged in the same house with me at
London; and Annie Elliot looked very coldly at him as he went
by her in the passage. That I am also in a close confederacy
with Lord Lyttelton, who, he hears, is his mortal enemy. That
the English nation were very fond of him on his first arrival;
but that Horace Walpole and I had totally alienated them from
him. He owns, however, that his belief of my treachery <!-- Page 346 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_346" id="Page_v2_346">[346]</a></span>went
no higher than suspicion, while he was in London; but it rose
to certainty after he arrived in the country; for that there
were several publications in the papers against him, which
could have proceeded from nobody but me, or my confederate,
Horace Walpole. The rest is all of a like strain, intermixed
with many lies and much malice. I own that I was very anxious
about this affair, but this letter has totally relieved me. I
write in a hurry, merely to satisfy your curiosity. I hope
soon to see you, and am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_346:1_302" id="FNanchor_346:1_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:1_302" class="fnanchor">[346:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There could have been no incident better calculated than this to create
a sensation in the coteries of Paris. Immediately on receiving the first
angry letter, Hume sent an indignant account of the ingratitude and
malevolence of Rousseau to the Baron D'Holbach, which proved a
delightfully exciting morsel to a party assembled at his house; for the
baron had told him, from the beginning, that he was warming a serpent in
his bosom.<a name="FNanchor_346:2_303" id="FNanchor_346:2_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:2_303" class="fnanchor">[346:2]</a> The very rapid celebrity which the story received does
not seem to have been anticipated by Hume, and he says, apologetically,
to Madame de Boufflers,&mdash;"I wrote, indeed, to Baron D'Holbach, without
either recommending or expecting secrecy: but I thought this story, like
others, would be told to eight or ten people; in a week or two, twenty
or thirty more might hear it, and it would require three months before
it would reach you at Pougues. I little imagined that a private story,
told to a private gentleman, could run over a whole kingdom in a moment.
If the King of England had declared war against the King of France, it
could not have been more suddenly the subject of conversation."<a name="FNanchor_346:3_304" id="FNanchor_346:3_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_346:3_304" class="fnanchor">[346:3]</a>
Between the rupture and the <!-- Page 347 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_347" id="Page_v2_347">[347]</a></span>publication of the narrative regarding it,
Hume seems to have written very abundantly on the subject, to his
friends in Paris. The following is one of his letters:&mdash;</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Le Blanc</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Lisle Street, Leicester Fields, 12th August, 1766.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have used the freedom to send to you, in two
packets, by this post, the whole train of my correspondence
with Rousseau, connected by a short narrative. I hope you will
have leisure to peruse it. The story is incredible, as well as
inconceivable, were it not founded on such authentic
documents. Surely never was there so much wickedness and
madness combined in one human creature; nor did ever any one
meet with such a return for such signal services as those I
performed towards him. But I am told that he used to say to
Duclos, and others, that he hated all those to whom he owed
any obligation. In that case I am fully entitled to his
animosity.</p>

<p>I am really at a loss what use to make of this collection. The
story, I am told, is very much the object of conversation at
Paris. Though my conduct has been entirely innocent, or
rather, indeed, very meritorious, it happens, no doubt, as is
usual in such ruptures, that I will bear a part of the blame;
from which a publication of these papers would entirely free
me: yet I own I have an antipathy and reluctance to appeal to
the public; and fear that such a publication would be the only
blame I could incur in this affair. You know that nobody's
judgment weighs farther with me than yours: think a little of
the matter. If <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M<sup>me.</sup> De Dupré</span> were in town, I would desire
her to give these papers a perusal, and tell me her opinions.
Unhappily M. Trudaine would only understand the French part,
which is by far the most considerable. What would his friend
Fontenelle have done in this situation?</p>

<p>I am as great a lover of peace as he, and have kept myself as
free from all literary quarrels; but surely neither he nor any
other person was ever engaged in a controversy with a man of
so much malice,&mdash;of such a profligate disposition to lies, and
such great talents. It is nothing to dispute my style or my
abilities as an historian or philosopher; my <!-- Page 348 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_348" id="Page_v2_348">[348]</a></span>books ought to
answer for themselves, or they are not worth the
defending;&mdash;to fifty writers who have attacked me on this
head, I never made the least reply. But this is a different
case; imputations are here thrown on my morals and my conduct;
and, though my case is so clear as not to admit of the least
controversy, yet it is only clear to those who know it; and I
am uncertain how far the public in Paris are in this case. At
London, a publication would be regarded as entirely
superfluous.</p>

<p>I must desire you to send these papers to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> after you
have read them: M. Turgot will get them from him. I should
desire that <em>he</em> saw them before he sets out for his
government.</p>

<p>Does not <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M<sup>me.</sup> de Montigny</span> laugh at me, that I should have
sent her, but a few weeks ago, the portrait of Rousseau, done
from an original in my possession, and should now send you
these papers, which prove him to be one of the worst men,
perhaps, that ever existed, if his frenzy be not some apology
for him. I beg my compliments to M. and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M<sup>me.</sup> Fourqueux</span>; and
am, with great truth and sincerity, my dear sir, your most
affectionate humble servant.<a name="FNanchor_348:1_305" id="FNanchor_348:1_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_348:1_305" class="fnanchor">[348:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>To Adam Smith, who was then in Paris, he wrote the following letter,
without date:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p>"You may see in <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. D'Alembert's</span> hands, the whole narrative of
my affair with Rousseau, along with the whole train of
correspondence. Pray, is it not <!-- Page 349 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_349" id="Page_v2_349">[349]</a></span>a nice problem, whether he be
not an arrant villain, or an arrant madman, or both. The last
is my opinion, but the villain seems to me to predominate most
in his character. I shall not publish them unless forced,
which you will own to be a very great degree of self-denial.
My conduct in this affair would do me a great deal of honour,
and his would blast him for ever, and blast his writings at
the same time; for as these have been exalted much above their
merit, when his personal character falls, they would of course
fall below their merit. I am, however, apprehensive that in
the end I shall be obliged to publish. About two or three days
ago, there was an article in the <cite>St. James's Chronicle</cite> ,
copied from the <cite>Brussels Gazette</cite> , which pointed at this
dispute. This may probably put Rousseau in a rage. He will
publish something, which may oblige me for my own honour to
give the narrative to the public. There will be no reason to
dread a long train of disagreeable controversy. One
publication begins and ends it on my side. Pray, tell me your
judgment of my work, if it deserves the name. Tell D'Alembert
I make him absolute master, to retrench or alter what he
thinks proper, in order to suit it to the latitude of Paris.</p>

<p>"Were you and I together, dear Smith, we should shed tears at
present for the death of poor Sir James Macdonald. We could
not possibly have suffered a greater loss, than in that
valuable young man. I am," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_349:1_306" id="FNanchor_349:1_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_349:1_306" class="fnanchor">[349:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There is a letter by Smith on the subject, kind and honest. It must be
kept in view, that it was written not only before the series of
documents, mentioned in <!-- Page 350 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_350" id="Page_v2_350">[350]</a></span>Hume's letter, had been sent to France, and
before the French friends had recommended Hume to publish, but before
the date of Rousseau's indictment. We shall, hereafter, find that Smith
seems to have withdrawn his objection to the publication.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Paris, 6th July, 1766.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I am thoroughly convinced that Rousseau is as
great a rascal as you and as every man here believes him to
be; yet let me beg of you, not to think of publishing any
thing to the world, upon the very great impertinence which he
has been guilty of to you. By refusing the pension which you
had the goodness to solicit for him with his own consent, he
may have thrown, by the baseness of his proceedings, some
little ridicule upon you in the eyes of the court and the
ministry. Stand this ridicule, expose his brutal letter, but
without giving it out of your own hand, so that it may never
be printed; and if you can, laugh at yourself, and I shall
pawn my life, that before three weeks are at an end, this
little affair, which at present gives you so much uneasiness,
shall be understood to do you as much honour as any thing that
has ever happened to you. By endeavouring to unmask before the
public this hypocritical pedant, you run the risk of
disturbing the tranquillity of your whole life. By letting him
alone, he cannot give you a fortnight's uneasiness. To write
against him is, you may depend upon it, the very thing he
wishes you to do. He is in danger of falling into obscurity in
England, and he hopes to make himself considerable, by
provoking an illustrious adversary. He will have a great
party: the Church, the Whigs, the Jacobites, the whole wise
English nation, who will love to mortify a Scotchman, and to
applaud a man who has refused a pension from the king. It is
not unlikely, too, that they may pay him very well for having
refused it, and that even he may have had in view this
compensation. Your whole friends here wish you not to
write&mdash;the Baron,<a name="FNanchor_350:1_307" id="FNanchor_350:1_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_350:1_307" class="fnanchor">[350:1]</a> <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert, Madame Riccoboni,
Mademoiselle <!-- Page 351 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_351" id="Page_v2_351">[351]</a></span>Rianecourt</span>, M. Turgot, &amp;c. &amp;c. M. Turgot, a
friend every way worthy of you, desired me to recommend this
advice to you in a particular manner, as his most earnest
entreaty and opinion. He and I are both afraid that you are
surrounded with evil counsellors, and that the advice of your
English literati, who are themselves accustomed to publish all
their little gossiping stories in newspapers, may have too
much influence upon you. Remember me to Mr. Walpole, and
believe me, &amp;c.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Smith was thus in consultation on the subject with the excellent Turgot,
who gave Hume his opinion at great length. On the 27th July, before he
could have heard of the long "indictment," he wrote<a name="FNanchor_351:1_308" id="FNanchor_351:1_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_351:1_308" class="fnanchor">[351:1]</a> that he could
trace the rage of Rousseau to two causes: first, Hume being the author
of one of the sarcasms in Walpole's letter, a rumour which Turgot
appears to have believed; and second, the interpreting the letter to Mr.
Conway as a refusal of the pension, which it was not intended by
Rousseau to be. If the latter was one of Rousseau's grievances, he did
not make it a count in the indictment. Turgot was ignorant of the
strength of provocation which Hume received. He says, that it is a
mistake to suppose Rousseau's conduct the effect of deliberate
design,&mdash;a view in which every one not in the vortex of the dispute must
have coincided with him; and on the ground that no sensible person will
believe that he is guilty of the charges his excited enemy may make
against him, he advises Hume not to treat them seriously. He even hints
that Hume should acknowledge that he misinterpreted the letter about the
pension, and should endeavour to coax Rousseau back to good humour, as a
public exposure would be unpleasant to both parties. On the 7th
September, after having seen all the <!-- Page 352 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_352" id="Page_v2_352">[352]</a></span>documents, he preserved the same
tone in speaking of Rousseau; recommending forbearance towards him: but
at the same time he expressed an opinion that Hume might find it
necessary to publish a narrative of the transaction.<a name="FNanchor_352:1_309" id="FNanchor_352:1_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_352:1_309" class="fnanchor">[352:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 353 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_353" id="Page_v2_353">[353]</a></span>We find that Smith was also in communication with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>,
who wrote to Hume at considerable length, in the knowledge of the first
angry letter, but not of the "indictment." She assumes a tone much the
same as that of Turgot, when he wrote in the same circumstances. She
expresses many regrets that Hume should have written so condemnatory a
letter to the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Baron D'Holbach</span>. He is told that those who <em>profess</em> to be
his friends in France will abet him, because he is proving himself to be
a mere ordinary human being, instead of continuing to show his
superiority to the common frailties of humanity. He is entreated to look
compassionately on a man who has overwhelmed himself with calamities,
and to treat one who is capable only of injuring himself <!-- Page 354 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_354" id="Page_v2_354">[354]</a></span>with generous
pity. While making these recommendations, she, as well as Turgot,
believed that one of the sarcasms in Walpole's letter had been suggested
by Hume.<a name="FNanchor_354:1_310" id="FNanchor_354:1_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:1_310" class="fnanchor">[354:1]</a> The same tone was taken up by Lord Marischal; who,
writing on the 15th August from Potsdam, seems not to have perused the
"indictment." "You did all in your power," says this kind old soldier,
"to serve him; his écart afflicts me on his account more than yours, who
have, I am sure, nothing to reproach yourself with. It will be good and
humane in you, and like Le Bon David, not to answer."<a name="FNanchor_354:2_311" id="FNanchor_354:2_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:2_311" class="fnanchor">[354:2]</a></p>

<p><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> was at first opposed to a publication, and to an exposure of
the follies of the wise before "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cette sotte bête appelée le public</span>." So
early, however, as the 21st of July, he communicates the solemn opinion
of himself and other friends in Paris, that after the publicity which
the dispute has acquired, it will be necessary for Hume to print a
narrative.<a name="FNanchor_354:3_312" id="FNanchor_354:3_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_354:3_312" class="fnanchor">[354:3]</a> He states that this is the opinion of all intelligent
people. <!-- Page 355 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_355" id="Page_v2_355">[355]</a></span>He says at the same time, that he had been speaking with Adam
Smith on the subject, and though his name is not among those of the
committee who recommended the publication, it may be presumed that he
had at length admitted it to be necessary.</p>

<p>In connexion with the letter from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span>, Hume wrote thus to
Walpole:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;When I came home last night, I found on my table a
very long letter from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span>, who tells me, that on
receiving from me an account of my affair with Rousseau, he
summoned a meeting of all my literary friends at Paris, and
found them all unanimously of the same opinion with himself,
and of a contrary opinion to me, with regard to my conduct.
They all think I ought to give to the public a narrative of
the whole. However, I persist still more closely in my first
opinion, especially after receiving the last mad letter.
D'Alembert tells me that it is of great importance for me to
justify myself from having any hand in the letter from the
King of Prussia. I am told by Crawford, that you had wrote it
a fortnight before I left Paris, but did not show it to a
mortal, for fear of hurting me; a delicacy of which I am very
sensible. Pray recollect if it was so. Though I do not intend
to publish, I am collecting all the original pieces, and I
shall connect them by a concise narrative. It is necessary for
me to have that letter and Rousseau's answer. Pray, assist me
in this work. About what time, do you think, were they
printed? I am, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_355:1_313" id="FNanchor_355:1_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_355:1_313" class="fnanchor">[355:1]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p><!-- Page 356 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_356" id="Page_v2_356">[356]</a></span>Hume, afterwards, sent to Paris all the documents connected with
Rousseau's attack, to be published or not, at the discretion of his
friends; and they were published. If it be asked how he permitted so
cruel a thing to be done, the answer is, that he was human, and had been
deeply injured; that he had a reputation to preserve, and did not
consider himself bound to sacrifice it to the peace of his assailant.
Rousseau had triumphantly written, hither and thither, that Hume dared
not publish the "indictment." He had said, that if he did not see David
Hume exposed ere he died, he would cease to believe in Providence. He
was occupied in writing his celebrated Confessions, and had
significantly hinted to Hume that he would find himself pilloried there.
It is possible to create an ideal image of a mind that would have calmly
resisted all these impulses, and let the traducer proceed unnoticed in
his frantic labours. It is probable that if he had adopted this course,
Hume would in the end have been as completely absolved from the
accusations of Rousseau, as he was by the publication of the accusation.
Had he thus scorned to adopt the usual means of protecting his good
name, his character would have appeared, to all who believed in his
innocence, more magnanimous than it was. But it certainly would not have
been so natural; and many of those who seemed to have expected that the
metaphysician should be above the influence of ordinary human passions,
appear to have forgotten, that there are few even of the men whose
office it is to teach that those smitten on the one cheek should present
the other, who would have shown even as much forbearance on the occasion
as David Hume.</p>

<p>The editing of the French version of these documents was committed to
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Suard</span>, the author of the <!-- Page 357 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_357" id="Page_v2_357">[357]</a></span><cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mélanges de Littérature</cite>. In answer to a letter
of 2d November,<a name="FNanchor_357:1_314" id="FNanchor_357:1_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_357:1_314" class="fnanchor">[357:1]</a> announcing the publication, Hume wrote to him in
the following terms, admitting, as the reader will perceive, that he had
used harsh expressions, and approving of their being softened.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Suard</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I cannot sufficiently express, my dear sir, all the
acknowledgments which I owe you for the pains you have taken
in translating a work, which so little merited your attention,
or the attention of the public. It is done entirely to my
satisfaction; and the introduction in particular is wrote with
great prudence and discretion in every point, except where
your partiality to me appears too strongly. I accept of it,
however, very willingly as a pledge of your friendship. You
and M. D'Alembert did well in softening some expressions,
especially in the notes; and I shall take care to follow these
corrections in the English edition. My paper, indeed, was not
wrote for the public eye; and nothing but a train of
unforeseen accidents could have engaged me to give it to the
<!-- Page 358 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_358" id="Page_v2_358">[358]</a></span>press. I am not surprised, that those who do not consider nor
weigh those circumstances, should blame this appeal to the
public; but it is certain that if I had persevered in keeping
silence, I should have passed for the guilty person, and those
very people who blame me at present, would, with the
appearance of reason, have thrown a much greater blame upon
me. This whole adventure, I must regard as a misfortune in my
life: and yet, even after all is past, when it is easy to
correct any errors, I am not sensible that I can accuse myself
of any imprudence; except in accepting of this man when he
threw himself into my arms: and yet it would then have
appeared cruel to refuse him. I am excusable for not expecting
to meet with such a prodigy of pride and ferocity, because
such a one never before existed. But after he had declared war
against me in so violent a manner, it could not have been
prudent in me to keep silence towards my friends, and to wait
till he should find a proper time to stab my reputation. From
my friends, the affair passed to the public, who interested
themselves more in a private story, than it was possible to
imagine; and rendered it quite necessary to lay the whole
before them. Yet, after all, if any one be pleased to think,
that by greater prudence I could have avoided this
disagreeable extremity, I am very willing to submit. It is not
surely the first imprudence I have been guilty of.<a name="FNanchor_358:1_315" id="FNanchor_358:1_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_358:1_315" class="fnanchor">[358:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Among other distinctions, the publication of the controversy brought
Hume a letter from Voltaire, in which the patriarch gave the history of
his own grievances against Rousseau, with all his usual sarcasm; and
said, of that absorbing vanity for which he might have had more fellow
feeling, that Rousseau, believing himself worthy of a statue, thought
one half of the world was occupied in raising it on its pedestal, and
the other in pulling it down.<a name="FNanchor_358:2_316" id="FNanchor_358:2_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_358:2_316" class="fnanchor">[358:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 359 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_359" id="Page_v2_359">[359]</a></span>This little collection, bearing the title, "<cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Exposé succint de la
contestation qui s'est élévée entre M. Hume et M. Rousseau, avec les
pieces justificatives</cite>," was soon afterwards published in English, under
Hume's own superintendence. He judiciously observed, that a translation
would undoubtedly appear, and that it was more honest, and at the same
time more conducive to his reputation, that he should himself
superintend the publication.</p>

<p>He had intimated, that as Rousseau would probably impugn the genuineness
of the letters as they appeared in print, he would deposit the originals
in a public library. In this view, he addressed the following letter to
the librarian of the British Museum.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 23d Jan. 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;As M. Rousseau had wrote to several of his
correspondents, that I never dared to publish the letters
which he had wrote me; or if I published them they would be so
falsified that they would not be the same, I was obliged to
say in my preface, that the originals would be consigned in
the Museum. I hope you have no objection to the receiving
them. I send them by my friend M. Ramsay. Be so good as to
give them the corner of any drawer. I fancy few people will
trouble you by desiring a sight of them. All the world seems
to be satisfied concerning the foundation of that unhappy
affair. Yet notwithstanding, I own, that I never in my life
took a step with so much reluctance as the consenting to that
publication. But as it appeared absolutely necessary to all my
friends <!-- Page 360 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_360" id="Page_v2_360">[360]</a></span>at Paris, I could not withstand their united opinion.
I have also sent the original of M. Walpole's letter to me,
which enters into the collection. I am, sir, your most
obedient, and most humble servant."<a name="FNanchor_360:1_317" id="FNanchor_360:1_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:1_317" class="fnanchor">[360:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It appears that the trustees of the British Museum, for some one or
other of the inscrutable reasons which occasionally sway the counsels of
such bodies, declined to receive this very curious collection of
documents. Dr. Maty, writing to Hume on 22d April, 1767, says, "I longed
to have some conversation with you on the subject of the papers, which
were remitted to me by the hands of M<sup>r.</sup> Ramsay, and as our trustees
did not think proper to receive them, to restore them into yours. With
respect to these papers, give me leave to assure you, that I had never
any doubt about the merits of the cause. I have long ago fixed my
opinion about R&mdash;&mdash;'s character, and think madness is the only excuse
that can be offered for his inconsistencies."<a name="FNanchor_360:2_318" id="FNanchor_360:2_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:2_318" class="fnanchor">[360:2]</a></p>

<p>Those original letters connected with the controversy, which were
addressed to Hume, whether by Rousseau or others, are among the papers
in possession of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. They bear marks of
having been much handled.<a name="FNanchor_360:3_319" id="FNanchor_360:3_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_360:3_319" class="fnanchor">[360:3]</a> Of the letters addressed to Rousseau,
which of course were <!-- Page 361 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_361" id="Page_v2_361">[361]</a></span>written in French, it is to be presumed that Hume
preserved the duplicates, which afterwards enabled him to show copies of
the documents on both sides. The originals probably do not exist; for
Rousseau, who held his own part in a controversy as the only important
one, appears not to have kept the letters addressed to him, though he
retained copies of his own.</p>

<p>The dispute with Rousseau very nearly produced a subsidiary discussion
with Horace Walpole. He said, alluding to the advice which had been
transmitted to Hume by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span>, "Your set of literary friends are
what a set of literary men are apt to be, exceedingly absurd. They hold
a consistory to consult how to argue with a madman; and they think it
very necessary for your character, to give them the pleasure of seeing
Rousseau exposed; not because he has provoked you, but them. If Rousseau
prints, you must; but I certainly would not, till he does."</p>

<p>Walpole evidently looked on this quarrel as a small dispute between
small people;&mdash;something on a par with the wrangling of country
gentlemen about their preserves and their swing gates.<a name="FNanchor_361:1_320" id="FNanchor_361:1_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_361:1_320" class="fnanchor">[361:1]</a> Yet, when
<!-- Page 362 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_362" id="Page_v2_362">[362]</a></span>he found that his own name appeared to be connected with it, he thought
it right to publish "a narrative of what passed relative to the quarrel
of Mr. David Hume and J. J. Rousseau, as far as Mr. Horace Walpole was
concerned in it." He very distinctly absolves Hume from any connexion
with the fictitious letter of the King of Prussia. The only wrong of
which he had to complain was, that Hume published this exoneration, of
which it seems a publication was not expected, though the letter
contained the words, "You are at full liberty, dear sir, to make use of
what I say in your justification, either to Rousseau or any body else;"
and that, in printing the letter, the passage above cited, reflecting on

<p>The only portion of Walpole's pamphlet that appears to possess any
interest, contains Hume's remarks on his friend, D'Alembert. They were
intended as an answer to Walpole's spiteful sneers; but, though
eulogistic, and apparently just, they by no means exhibit a violent
encomiastic zeal.</p>

irreproachable morals. By refusing great offers from the
Czarina and the King of Prussia, he has shown himself above
interest and vain ambition. He lives in an agreeable retreat
at Paris, suitable to a man of letters. He has five pensions:
one from the King of Prussia, one from the French King, one as
member of the Academy of Sciences, one as member of the French
Academy, and one from his own family. The whole amount of
these is not six thousand livres a-year; on the half of which
he lives decently, and gives the other half to poor people
with whom he is connected. In a word, I scarce know a man,
who, with some few exceptions, (for there must always be some
exceptions,) is a better model of a <em>virtuous</em> and
<em>philosophical</em> character.</p>

<p>You see I venture still to join these two epithets as
inseparable, and almost synonymous, though you seem inclined
to regard them almost as incompatible. And here I have a
strong inclination to say a few words in vindication, both of
myself and my friends; venturing even to comprehend you in the
number. What new prepossession has seized you, to beat in so
outrageous a manner your nurses of Mount Helicon, and to join
the outcry of the ignorant multitude against science and
literature? For my part, I can scarce acknowledge any other
ground of distinction between one age and another, between one
nation and another, than their different progress in learning
and the arts. I do not say between one man and another,
because the qualities of the heart and temper, and natural
understanding, are the most essential to the personal
character; but being, I suppose, almost equal among nations
and ages, do not serve to throw a peculiar lustre on any. You
blame France for its fond admiration of men of genius; and
there may no doubt be, in particular instances, a great
ridicule in these affectations; but the sentiment, in general,
was equally conspicuous in ancient Greece; in Rome, during its
flourishing period; in modern Italy; and even, perhaps, in
England about the beginning of this century. If the case be
now otherwise, it is what we are to lament and be ashamed of.
Our enemies will only infer, that we are a nation which was
once, at best, but half civilized; and is now relapsing fast
into barbarism, <!-- Page 364 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_364" id="Page_v2_364">[364]</a></span>ignorance, and superstition. I beg you also
to consider the great difference, in point of morals, between
uncultivated and civilized ages. But I find I am launching out
insensibly into an immense ocean of commonplace. I cut the
matter, therefore, short, by declaring it as my opinion, that
if you had been born a barbarian, and had every day cooked
your dinner of horse flesh, by riding on it fifty miles
between your breech and the shoulder of your horse, you had
certainly been an obliging, good-natured, friendly man; but,
at the same time, that reading, conversation, and travel, have
detracted nothing from these virtues, and have made a
considerable addition of other valuable and agreeable
qualities to them. I remain, not with ancient sincerity, which
was only roguery and hypocrisy, but very sincerely, dear sir,
&amp;c.</p>

<p>Rousseau did not resign his pension, and made it be very distinctly
known that he would insist upon his claims to be paid what had been
promised; but he would not owe it to the intervention of David Hume. He
continued to reside for several months at Wooton, where he made some
progress in his renowned "Confessions." "He is, I am sure," says Mr.
Davenport, in one of his letters, "busy writing; and it should be some
large affair, from the quantity of paper he bought." Like other mental
patients, when long separated from his favourite excitement, his mind
became attuned to less tumultuous movements; and he ceased, in some
measure, to feel the want of notoriety. The visions of conspiracy and
treachery gradually disappeared, and now we find him, in his letters,
only saying; "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n'ai rien à dire de M. Hume, sinon que je le trouve
bien insultant pour un bon homme, et bien bruyant pour un philosophe</span>."
He had a genuine love of nature and of rural pursuits; and he appears to
have varied his literary labours, by joining in some projects of Mr.
Davenport for the cultivation of forest lands.</p>

<p><!-- Page 365 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_365" id="Page_v2_365">[365]</a></span>Writing to Blair, on 14th February, 1767, Hume says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"General Conway told me, on my arrival, that Rousseau had made
an application to him, through the canal of Mr. Davenport, to
have his pension granted to him. The general's answer was,
that I was to be in town in a few days; and, without my
consent, and even full approbation, he would take no step in
that affair. You may believe that I exhorted him to do so
charitable an action. I wish he may not find a difficulty with
the King, who is very much prejudiced against Rousseau.<a name="FNanchor_365:1_322" id="FNanchor_365:1_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:1_322" class="fnanchor">[365:1]</a>
This step of my old friend confirms the suspicion which I
always entertained, that he thought he had interest enough to
obtain the pension of himself; and that he had only picked a
quarrel with me in order to free himself from the humiliating
burden of gratitude towards me. His motives, therefore, were
much blacker than many seem to apprehend them.</p>

<p>"A gentleman told me that he heard, from the French
ambassador, that his most Christian Majesty had given an
arrêt, prohibiting, under the severest penalties, the
printing, vending, or dispersing, any paper of Rousseau, or
his partisans, against me. I dine with the ambassador to-day,
so shall know the truth of the matter, which scarce appears
credible. It is surely very honourable for me; but yet will
occasion that strange man to complain, that he is oppressed
with power all over the world. I am,"<a name="FNanchor_365:2_323" id="FNanchor_365:2_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_365:2_323" class="fnanchor">[365:2]</a> &amp;c.</p>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 366 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_366" id="Page_v2_366">[366]</a></span>At length, on the 31st of April, 1767, Rousseau and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mademoiselle Le
Vasseur</span> suddenly disappeared from Wooton together. Hume thus describes
the incident in a letter to Blair:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You may, perhaps, have heard that Rousseau has eloped from Mr.
Davenport, without giving any warning; leaving all his baggage, except
Mademoiselle, about thirty pounds in Davenport's hands, and a letter on
the table, abusing him in the most violent terms, insinuating that he
was in a conspiracy with me to ruin him.<a name="FNanchor_366:1_324" id="FNanchor_366:1_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:1_324" class="fnanchor">[366:1]</a> He took the road to
London, but was missing for about a fortnight. At last he emerges at
Spalding in Lincolnshire, whence he writes a letter to the Chancellor,
informing him that the bad usage he had met with in England, made it
absolutely necessary for him to evacuate the kingdom, and desiring his
lordship to send him a guard to escort him to Dover&mdash;this being the last
act of hospitality he will desire of the nation. He is plainly mad,
though I believe not more than he has been all his life. The pamphlet
you mention was wrote by one as mad as himself, and it was believed at
first to be by Tristram Shandy, but proves to be [by] one Fuseli an
engraver. He is a fanatical admirer of Rousseau, but owns he was in the
wrong to me. The pamphlet I sent to you was wrote by an English
clergyman, whom I never saw; a man of character, and rising in the
church,<a name="FNanchor_366:2_325" id="FNanchor_366:2_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_366:2_325" class="fnanchor">[366:2]</a> for which reason it is more prudent in <!-- Page 367 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_367" id="Page_v2_367">[367]</a></span>me to conceal his
name. When would <em>you</em> have done so much for me."<a name="FNanchor_367:1_326" id="FNanchor_367:1_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_367:1_326" class="fnanchor">[367:1]</a></p>

<p>As Rousseau did not favour the world in his "Confessions," with the
adventures he encountered during this flight, it is of some interest, in
the absence of a personal narrative, to mark the impression produced by
the incident on an onlooker, whom it seems to have filled with mingled
feelings of compassion and astonishment. The following are some extracts
from Mr. Davenport's letters to Hume:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;After all my inquiries, I can't, for the life of
me, find out to what part my wild philosopher is fled. I sent
after him some papers, thinking they would most certainly find
him in London. No such matter: he is not to be found there.
They scarce took any thing along with them, but what they
carried on their backs. All the trunks, &amp;c. are at Wooton; and
this odd man has just packed up his things, and left the keys
dangling at the locks of his boxes. No sort of direction for
me, though he knows I am in his debt between £30 and £40; and
I want, of all things, to inform him what he has to do in
relation to his majesty's bounty, which I am sure he will with
great satisfaction receive, because I have it so positively
under his own hand. You shall have the joy of perusing his
letter; but one dated about six days before must be added to
it. <!-- Page 368 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_368" id="Page_v2_368">[368]</a></span>At present my gout is too much upon me to write copies of
them. Pray, if you hear where he is, do me the pleasure to
inform me. I am, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>P.S.&mdash;I protest I pity him more and more, as I certainly
conclude that his head is not quite right.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall bqsmbot">
<p class="letterdateit">Davenport, Monday 18th.</p>

<p>I can't help giving you the trouble of this. Last night I
received a most melancholy letter from poor Rousseau, dated
Spalding in Lincolnshire. How, or on what account, he got to
that place, I can't for the life of me guess; but this I
learn, that he is most excessively sick of his situation, and
is returning to Wooton, as soon as, I suppose, he can well get
there. He has been all the time at an inn in that town. Pray,
was the place you mentioned to me in that county, any where
near Spalding? I own to you, I was quite moved to read his
mournful epistle. I am quite confirmed in my opinion of him:
this last from him, is entirely different in style, from any I
ever yet received. I have in my answer, desired he would write
to some friend of his in town, to authorize him to receive his
majesty's bounty, as it becomes due. I have told him that his
agent must apply, and show his letter to Mr. Lounds of the
Treasury. Poor Rousseau writes of nothing but his misery,
illness, afflictions; in a word, of his being the most
unfortunate man that ever existed. Good God! most of those
distresses are surely occasioned by his own unhappy temper,
which I really believe is not in his power to alter! so, let
him be where he will, I fear he is certain to be uneasy. His
passion for Botany has, as I conjecture, almost left him. If I
am right in my guess, I have no sort of doubt, but he will
again take to his pen, as 'tis impossible for his imagination
to remain idle. I am, &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall bqsmbot">
<p class="letterdateit">Davenport, May 25, 1767.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;'Tis with the greatest satisfaction I hear, this
poor unfortunate man will enjoy the pension. I am sure he lies
under a thousand obligations to you, and am extremely glad he
has wrote to General Conway. I hope he made use of at least
some expressions of gratitude and respect to that gentleman,
whose goodness of heart obtained this favour from his majesty.</p>

<p>I am sure you'll do your endeavour to save him from the
<!-- Page 369 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_369" id="Page_v2_369">[369]</a></span>Bastile, or (which I more fear) the Archbishop of Paris'
prison.</p>

<p>He wrote me a letter from Spalding, dated 11th, in which he
says, I have great reason to be offended at his manner of
leaving Wooton. He says,&mdash;</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je préférois la liberté, au séjour de votre maison; ce
sentiment est bien excusable. Mais je préfère infiniment le
séjour de votre maison à tout autre captivité, et je
préférerois toute captivité à celle où je suis, qui est
horrible, et qui, quoiqu'il arrive ne sauroit durer. Si vous
voulez bien Monsieur me recevoir derechef chez vous, je suis
prêt à m'y rendre au cas qu'on m'en laisse la liberté, et
quand j'y serois après l'expérience qui j'ai faite,
difficilement serois-je tenté d'en ressortir pour chercher de
nouveaux malheurs. Si ma proposition vous agrée, tâchez,
Monsieur de me le faire savoir par quelque voie sûre, et de
faciliter mon retour d'ici chez vous.</p>

<p>He repeats the same request of sending to him two or three
times. This which he sent on the 11th, I received on the 17th.
On the 18th I despatched a servant to Spalding: instead of
staying for my answer, behold, on the 14th he set out for
Dover, and on that morning wrote again by the post to me, in
which he says, that if he had any assurance this letter of the
11th would come to me, and that I would agree to his
proposals, and again receive him, he should certainly stay for
an answer; but as he despaired of my receiving his, so he was
determined to pass the Channel, and I should hear from him
when he reached Calais, and quite sure of his liberty; that he
would write from thence and make me a very singular
proposition. He professes the greatest regard for me, &amp;c. The
next is dated, Dover, 18th May, where he says, that he chose
to write to me from that place; that seeing the sea, and
finding he was in reality a free man, and might either go or
stay,&mdash;then, says he, I stopped, and intended to return to
you; but by chance seeing in a public paper how my departure
from Wooton was treated, caused him immediately to renounce
that idea. He finishes with many compliments, but without
telling me where to write to him, and I long to know how to
address my letters. Before he left Wooton, he disposed of
several long gowns amongst the poor people, went off in an old
French dress, and got a blue coat made <!-- Page 370 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_370" id="Page_v2_370">[370]</a></span>for him at Spalding.
Pray, can you inform me who he has authorized to receive his
majesty's bounty; because I think I may pay into their hands
the money I have of his in mine. I should be pleased if you
could be so kind as to inform me what date his letter bore,
which he wrote to the Lord Chancellor. I am, dear sir, &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall bqsmbot">
<p class="letterdateit">4th July, 1767.</p>

<p>This week I received a letter from Rousseau, dated, Fleury
under Meudon, wrote with great complaisance; he returns a
thousand thanks for all the civilities he received from me at
Wooton; says that he is not fixed as to the place of his
future residence, but that he will inform me as soon as he has
made choice of one.</p>

<p>The style of this is vastly different from some of the last of
those which he wrote in England; no mention of captivities, no
wild imaginations of any kind, but entirely calm and composed.
I heartily wish he may continue so, then sure he will be
somewhat happy. I am, &amp;c.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">6th July, 1767.</p>

<p>The good woman who is called my housekeeper was my nurse, near
ninety, and more than three parts blind. Mad<sup>lle</sup> and she
never could agree. I have heard something of the story of the
kettle and cinders,<a name="FNanchor_370:1_327" id="FNanchor_370:1_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_370:1_327" class="fnanchor">[370:1]</a> but am inclinable to believe my
philosopher's resolutions were determined before that fray
happened. His governante has an absolute power over him, and
without doubt more or less influences all his actions. You
certainly guess right about the unaccountable quarrel with
you, to whom he has so many and great obligations: nay, I am
almost sure he very heartily repents and inwardly wants to be
reconciled. He has desired to hear from me often, and promises
to let me know how he goes on, as soon as ever he is the least
fixed. What he was writing, is the same he mentioned to you,
will be a large work, containing <!-- Page 371 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_371" id="Page_v2_371">[371]</a></span>at least twelve volumes. I
am positively certain that when I left him, he had not
entirely finished one. There's nothing in it which in any
shape relates to state affairs or to ministers of state.</p>

<p>You shall see his letter the first opportunity; but, God help
him! I can't, for pity, give a copy; and 'tis so much mixed
with his own poor little private concerns, that it would not
be right in me to do it.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I am, dear sir, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_371:1_328" id="FNanchor_371:1_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_371:1_328" class="fnanchor">[371:1]</a></p>

<p>In the following letters, Hume narrates these events to his Northern
friends, having been so frequently desired to give explanations of the
rumours regarding Rousseau's escapades which occasionally reached
Scotland, that he found it most expedient to answer miscellaneous
inquiries by general chronological narratives.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"27th May, 1767.</p>

<p>"Since you are curious to hear Rousseau's story, I shall tell
you the sequel of it. A few days after his letter to the
Chancellor, of which I informed you, I got a letter from
Davenport, who told me that he had just received a letter from
Rousseau, dated at Spalding, wherein that wild philosopher, as
he calls him, appeared very penitent, and contrite, and
melancholy; and expressed his purpose of returning immediately
to his former retreat at Wooton. The same day, and nearly the
same hour, General Conway received a long letter from him,
dated at Dover, about two hundred miles distant from Spalding.
This great journey he had made in two days; and had probably
set out immediately after writing the letter <!-- Page 372 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_372" id="Page_v2_372">[372]</a></span>above-mentioned
to Davenport.<a name="FNanchor_372:1_329" id="FNanchor_372:1_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_372:1_329" class="fnanchor">[372:1]</a> This letter to General Conway is the most
frenzical imaginable. He there supposes that he was brought
into England by a plot of mine, in order to reduce him to
infamy, derision, and captivity. That General Conway, and all
the most considerable personages of the nation, and the nation
itself, had entered into this conspiracy. That he is at
present actually a state prisoner in General Conway's hands,
and has been so ever since his arrival in the kingdom. He
entreats him, however, to allow him the liberty of departing;
warns him that it will not be safe to assassinate him in
private; as he is unhappily too well known not to have
inquiries made, if he should disappear on a sudden; and
promises that if his request be granted, his memoirs shall
never be printed to disgrace the English ministry and the
English nation.</p>

<p>"He owns that he has wrote such memoirs, the chief object of
which was to deliver a faithful account of the treatment he
has met with in England; but he promises, that the moment he
sets foot on the French shore, he shall write to the friend in
whose hand the manuscript is deposited, to deliver it to the
General, who may destroy it if he pleases. He adds, that as it
may be objected, that after recovering his liberty he may do
as he pleases, he offers, as a pledge of his sincerity, to
accept of his pension; after which he thinks no one will
imagine he could be so infamous as to write against the king's
ministers or his people. Amidst all this frenzy, he employs
these terms as if a ray of reason had for a moment broke into
his mind. <!-- Page 373 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_373" id="Page_v2_373">[373]</a></span>He says, speaking of himself in the third person,
'<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Non-seulement il abandonne pour toujours le projet d'écrire
sa vie et ses mémoires, mais il ne lui échappera jamais, ni de
bouche ni par écrit, un seul mot de plainte sur les malheurs
qui lui sont arrivés en Angleterre; il ne parlera jamais de M.
Hume, ou il n'en parlera qu'avec honneur, et lorsqu'il sera
pressé de s'expliquer sur quelques indiscrètes plaintes, qui
lui sont quelquefois échappées dans le fort de ses peines, il
les rejettera sans mystère, sur son humeur aigrie et portée à
la défiance, et aux ombrages par ce malheureux penchant,
ouvrage de ses malheurs, et qui maintenant y met le
comble</span>.'<a name="FNanchor_373:1_330" id="FNanchor_373:1_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_373:1_330" class="fnanchor">[373:1]</a></p>

<p>"We hear that notwithstanding his imagined captivity, he has
passed over to Calais; where he is likely to experience what
real captivity is. I have, however, used my persuasion with
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons<sup>r</sup> de Guerchi</span> to represent him to his court as a real
madman, more an object of compassion than of anger. We shall
no doubt see his Memoirs in a little time: which will be full
of eloquence and extravagance, though perhaps as reasonable as
any of his past productions; for I do not imagine he was ever
much more in his senses than at present. <!-- Page 374 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_374" id="Page_v2_374">[374]</a></span>I think I may be

<p>The following letters to Smith appear to have been intended as a
comprehensive history of the flight of Rousseau. The reader will readily
excuse the repetition of some incidents already mentioned, and may
perhaps find an interest in comparing the impressions produced by the
events as they were successively occurring, with this general retrospect
of the whole.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 8th October, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I shall give you an account of the late
heteroclite exploits of Rousseau, as far as I can recollect
them. There is no need of any secrecy: they are most of them
pretty public, and are well known to every body that had
curiosity to observe the actions of that strange, undefinable
existence, whom one would be apt to imagine an imaginary
being, though surely not an <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ens rationis</i>.</p>

<p>"I believe you know, that in spring last, Rousseau applied to
General Conway to have his pension. The General answered to
Mr. Davenport, who carried the application, that I was
expected to town in a few days; and without my consent and
approbation he would take no steps in that affair. You may
believe I readily gave my consent. I also solicited the
affair, through the Treasury; and the whole being finished, I
wrote to Mr. Davenport, and desired him to inform his guest,
that he needed only appoint any person to receive payment. Mr.
Davenport answered me, that it was out of his power to execute
my commission: for that his wild philosopher, as he called
him, had eloped <!-- Page 375 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_375" id="Page_v2_375">[375]</a></span>of a sudden, leaving a great part of his
baggage behind him, some money in Davenport's hands, and a
letter on the table, as odd, he says, as the one he wrote to
me, and implying that Mr. Davenport was engaged with me in a
treacherous conspiracy against him! He was not heard of for a
fortnight, till the Chancellor received a letter from him,
dated at Spalding in Lincolnshire; in which he said that he
had been seduced into this country by a promise of
hospitality; that he had met with the worst usage; that he was
in danger of his life from the plots of his enemies; and that
he applied to the Chancellor, as the first civil magistrate of
the kingdom, desiring him to appoint a guard at his own
(Rousseau's) expense, who might safely conduct him out of the
kingdom. The Chancellor made his secretary reply to him, that
he was mistaken in the nature of the country; for that the
first post-boy he could apply to, was as safe a guide as the
Chancellor could appoint. At the very same time that Rousseau
wrote this letter to the Chancellor, he wrote to Davenport,
that he had eloped from him, actuated by a very natural
desire, that of recovering his liberty; but finding he must
still be in captivity, he preferred that at Wooton: for his
captivity at Spalding was intolerable beyond all human
patience, and he was at present the most wretched being on the
face of the globe: he would therefore return to Wooton, if he
were assured that Davenport would receive him.</p>

<p>"Here I must tell you, that the parson of Spalding was about
two months ago in London, and told Mr. Fitzherbert, from whom
I had it, that he had passed several hours every day with
Rousseau, while he was in that place; that he was cheerful,
good-humoured, easy, and enjoyed himself perfectly well,
without the least fear or complaint of any kind. However this
<!-- Page 376 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_376" id="Page_v2_376">[376]</a></span>may be, our hero, without waiting for any answer, either from
the Chancellor or Mr. Davenport, decamps on a sudden from
Spalding, and takes the road directly to Dover; whence he
writes a letter to General Conway, seven pages long, and full
of the wildest extravagance in the world. He says, that he had
endured a captivity in England, which it was impossible any
longer to submit to. It was strange, that the greatest in the
nation, and the whole nation itself, should have been seduced
by one private man, to serve his vengeance against another
private man: he found in every face that he was here the
object of general derision and aversion, and he was therefore
infinitely desirous to remove from this country. He therefore
begs the General to restore him to his liberty, and allow him
to leave England; he warns him of the danger there may be of
cutting his throat in private; as he is unhappily a man too
well known, not to have inquiries made after him, should he
disappear of a sudden: he promises, on condition of his being
permitted to depart the kingdom, to speak no ill of the king
or country, or ministers, or even of Mr. Hume; as indeed, says
he, I have perhaps no reason; my jealousy of him having
probably arisen from my own suspicious temper, soured by
misfortunes. He says, that he wrote a volume of Memoirs,
chiefly regarding the treatment he has met with in England; he
has left it in safe hands, and will order it to be burned, in
case he be permitted to go beyond seas, and nothing shall
remain to the dishonour of the king and his ministers.</p>

<p>"This letter is very well wrote, so far as regards the style
and composition; and the author is so vain of it, that he has
given about copies, as of a rare production. It is indeed, as
General Conway says, the composition of a whimsical man, not
of a madman. <!-- Page 377 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_377" id="Page_v2_377">[377]</a></span>But what is more remarkable, the very same post,
he wrote to Davenport, that, having arrived within sight of
the sea, and finding he was really at liberty to go or stay,
as he pleased, he had intended voluntarily to return to him;
but seeing in a newspaper an account of his departure from
Wooton, and concluding his offences were too great to be
forgiven, he was resolved to depart for France. Accordingly,
without any farther preparation, and without waiting General
Conway's answer, he took his passage in a packet boat, and
went off that very evening. Thus, you see, he is a composition
of whim, affectation, wickedness, vanity, and inquietude, with
a very small if any ingredient of madness. He is always
complaining of his health; yet I have scarce ever seen a more
robust little man of his years. He was tired in England; where
he was neither persecuted nor caressed, and where, he was
sensible, he had exposed himself. He resolved, therefore, to
leave it; and having no pretence, he is obliged to contrive
all those absurdities, which he himself, extravagant as he is,
gives no credit to. At least, this is the only key I can
devise to his character. The ruling qualities above-mentioned,
together with ingratitude, ferocity, and lying,&mdash;I need not
mention eloquence and invention,&mdash;form the whole of the
composition.</p>

<p>"When he arrived at Paris, all my friends, who were likewise
all his, agreed totally to neglect him. The public, too,
disgusted with his multiplied and indeed criminal
extravagancies, showed no manner of concern about him. Never
was such a fall from the time I took him up, about a year and
a half before. I am told by D'Alembert and Horace Walpole,
that, sensible of this great alteration, he endeavoured to
regain his credit by acknowledging to every body his <!-- Page 378 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_378" id="Page_v2_378">[378]</a></span>fault
with regard to me: but all in vain: he has retired to a
village in the mountains of Auvergne, as M. Durand tells me,
where nobody inquires after him. He will probably endeavour to
recover his fame by new publications; and I expect with some
curiosity the reading of his Memoirs, which will I suppose
suffice to justify me in every body's eyes, and in my own, for
the publication of his letters and my narrative of the case.
You will see by the papers, that a new letter of his to M. D.,
which I imagine to be Davenport, is published. This letter was
probably wrote immediately on his arrival at Paris; or perhaps
is an effect of his usual inconsistence: I do not much concern
myself which. Thus he has had the satisfaction, during a time,
of being much talked of, for his late transactions; the thing
in the world he most desires: but it has been at the expense
of being consigned to perpetual neglect and oblivion. My
compliments to Mr. Oswald; and also to Mrs. Smith. I am,"

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 17th October, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I sit down to correct a mistake or two in the
former account which I gave you of Rousseau. I saw Davenport a
few days ago, who tells me, that the letter inserted in all
the newspapers, was never addressed to him. He even doubts its
being genuine; both because he knows it to be opposite to all
his sentiments with regard to me, to whom he desires earnestly
to be reconciled, and because it is too absurd and
extravagant, and seems to be contrived rather as a banter upon
him. Davenport added, that Rousseau was retired to some place
<!-- Page 379 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_379" id="Page_v2_379">[379]</a></span>in France, and had changed his name and his dress:<a name="FNanchor_379:1_333" id="FNanchor_379:1_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_379:1_333" class="fnanchor">[379:1]</a> but
wrote to him that he was the most miserable of all beings;
that it was impossible for him to stay where he was; and that
he would return to his old hermitage, if Davenport would
accept of him. Indeed, he has some reason to be mortified with
his reception in France; for Horace Walpole, who has very
lately returned thence, tells me, that though Rousseau is
settled at Cliché, within a league of Paris, nobody inquires
after him, nobody visits him, nobody talks of him, every one
has agreed to neglect and disregard him: a more sudden
revolution of fortune than almost ever happened to any man&mdash;at
least to any man of letters.</p>

<p>"I asked Mr. Davenport about those Memoirs, which Rousseau
said he was writing, and whether he had ever seen them. He
said, yes, he had; it was projected to be a work in twelve
volumes; but he had as yet gone no farther than the first
volume, which he had entirely composed at Wooton. It was
charmingly wrote, and concluded with a very particular and
interesting account of his first love, the object of which was
a person whose first love it also was. Davenport, who is no
bad judge, says, that these Memoirs will be the most taking of
all his works; and, indeed, you may easily imagine what such a
pen would make of such a subject as that I mentioned.
Meanwhile it appears clearly, what I told you before, that he
is no more mad at present, than he has been during the whole
course of his life, and that he is capable of the same efforts
of genius. I think I may wait in security his account of the
transactions between us. But, however, this incident, <!-- Page 380 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_380" id="Page_v2_380">[380]</a></span>which I
foresaw, is some justification of me for publishing his
letters, and may apologise for a step, which you, and even
myself, have been inclined sometimes to blame, and always to
regret."<a name="FNanchor_380:1_334" id="FNanchor_380:1_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_380:1_334" class="fnanchor">[380:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>So ended Rousseau's wild sojourn, in what he termed "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">l'heureuse terre,
où sont nés David Hume et le Maréchal d'Ecosse</span>." When the wounds
inflicted on his benefactor by ungrateful actions and uncharitable
interpretations had been healed by time, and the conduct of him who had
occasioned them was seen no longer through the excited medium of
lacerated feelings, the hour had come for the just understanding to aid
the kind heart, in estimating the character of the assailant; for
finding that, deep as were the wounds he might inflict on others, there
was an arrow still more deeply buried in his own bosom; that
commiseration should take the place of resentment; and that the
wanderer's footsteps should be accompanied by the prayer, that peace
might revisit his disturbed spirit. Hume felt, perhaps, what he could
not have expressed so well as one whose mind had too much in common with
that which he describes,</p>

<div class="poem">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">His life was one long war with self-sought foes;</div>
    <div class="line i1">Or friends by him self-banished; for his mind</div>
    <div class="line">Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose,</div>
    <div class="line i1">For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,</div>
    <div class="line i1">'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.</div>
    <div class="line">But he was frenzied,&mdash;wherefore, who may know?</div>
    <div class="line i1">Since cause might be which skill could never find;</div>
    <div class="line">But he was frenzied by disease or woe,</div>
    <div class="line i1">To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Hume was not a man given to the clamorous expression of contritions or
regrets. It is in his silence <!-- Page 381 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_381" id="Page_v2_381">[381]</a></span>and his subsequent acts that we find him
desirous to compensate for the punishment he had inflicted on his
assailant. The letters of his French friends, during the summer of 1767,
show that he had earnestly exerted himself to protect Rousseau from the
vengeance of the government;<a name="FNanchor_381:1_335" id="FNanchor_381:1_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_381:1_335" class="fnanchor">[381:1]</a> and there is all reason to believe,
that it was through this intervention that the wanderer was permitted to
pursue his course in peace. On the other hand, when the dark cloud had
completely passed away, the monomaniac appears to have awakened to a
distressing consciousness of what he had done. He afterwards attributed
his conduct in England to our foggy atmosphere, which had filled his
mind with gloom and discontent; and the work at which he laboured busily
with the fierce excitement of him who forges a weapon to avenge his
wrongs, stopped short at the very point where his narrative of injuries
was to commence.</p>

amusements was, drawing a vehement picture of his misfortunes and his
poverty; and after having thus laid a sort of trap, catching some
benevolent person in the act of secretly attempting to aid him. Many of
his letters are like those of a petty dealer, who is afraid of being
imposed on, and must see that all the consignments are exact, as per
invoice and account. The matter of the return chaise already alluded to,
slightly tinges the good humour of the former of these letters. In the
other, there are some remonstrances about a model of a bust of himself,
which he will not take from the artist unless it is to be paid for. The
same letter contains the following passage, which the editors of the
"Exposé Succinct" did not think it necessary to print. It illustrates
Rousseau's occasional attention to small matters.</p>

<p>Rousseau thought it worse than strange, that the person who wrote this
letter should have been intrusted with the conveyance of a parcel to
him, holding it to be clear that Walpole must necessarily be a person
who could not be intrusted with his property. M. Musset Pathay, in his
"Vie de Rousseau," makes a serious charge against Hume, in connexion
with Walpole's conduct. Hume confessed his being present when one of the
pleasantries of the letter was uttered in conversation. "Horace
Walpole's letter," he says to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Barbantane</span>, "was not founded on
any pleasantry of mine. The only pleasantry in that letter came from his
own mouth in my company, at Lord Ossory's table, which my lord remembers
very well." (<cite>Private Correspondence</cite> , p. 146.) On this passage, M.
Musset says: "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Elle prouve que l'historien Anglais s'est permis une
plaisanterie contre Jean Jacques, au moment même ou, lui témoignant le
plus grand intérêt, il se préparait à l'emmener en Angleterre. Ainsi, à
l'époque où David donnait à Rousseau les plus grandes marques d'amitié,
il contribuait d'un côté à le rendre un objet de ridicule, par un bon
mot qui fit partie du persiflage d'Horace Walpole</span>," (i. 115.) If the
reader thinks he here finds a French statesman announcing the rigid
doctrine of sincerity, that no man should patiently hear his friend's
foibles laughed at, he will find, on examining the passage, that M.
Musset has chosen to speak of Hume as the <em>author</em> of the jest. In
harmony with this view he, innocently it is to be presumed, translates
the above sentence in Hume's letter thus:&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La seule plaisanterie que je
me sois permise relativement à la prétendue lettre du roi de Prusse, fut

to imagine it. I suppose it is some trifle, aggravated by his melancholy
temper and lively fancy. I shall endeavour to learn from Mr. Davenport,
who is just gone to that neighbourhood. Lady Aylesbury and General
Conway believe that it is Horace Walpole's letter which still torments
him. That letter was put into our newspapers; which produced an answer,
full of passion, and indeed of extravagance, complaining in the most
tragical terms of the forgery, and lamenting that the impostor should
find any abettors and partisans in England. Mr. Walpole has wrote a
reply, full of vivacity and wit, but sacrifices it to his humanity, and
is resolved that no copy of it shall get abroad. He assures me that he,
as well as Madame du Deffand, were entirely innocent of that publication
at Paris: it was a lady, a friend of yours, who gave the first copy."

method of viewing the matter, and that in a book otherwise of merit. One
would hardly expect to meet with a work of the nineteenth century,
containing a serious vindication of Rousseau, as a sane man who was in
the right in this quarrel, while Hume was in the wrong. Yet some such
task has been undertaken in the "<cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Histoire de la Vie et des Ouvrages de
J. J. Rousseau</cite>," by the late <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Musset Pathay</span>, (1821,) which may be
ranked among the boldest efforts of that school of biographers, whose
principle is, that the hero of their tale must not be admitted to have
had any vice or weakness. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Musset's</span> charges against Hume are much of
the same mystical character with those made by Rousseau himself, and
amount to this, that there was something in the whole aspect of affairs
not quite satisfactory. He deals with some small matters of fact,&mdash;he is
very indignant that Hume should, as he confesses, have tried to prevent
Rousseau from plunging into a distant solitude; and we have already seen
the effect which his zeal has had on his discrimination, in the affair
of Walpole's letter. He makes one discovery, of which it would be unjust
to deny him the full merit. Hume says, in his Vindication, "It is with
reluctance I say it, but I am compelled to it. I now know of a
certainty, that this affectation of extreme poverty and distress was a
mere pretence, a petty kind of imposture, which M. Rousseau successfully
employed to excite the compassion of the public: but I was then very far
from suspecting any such artifice." In a letter to Madame de Boufflers,
he says, "I should be glad to know how your inquiries at M. Rougemont's
have turned out. It is only matter of mere curiosity: for even if the
fact should prove against him, which is very improbable, I should only
regard it as one weakness more, and do not make my good opinion of him
to depend on a single incident." (<cite>Private Correspondence</cite> , p. 130.) Now
Rougemont was a banker, and M. Musset infers that Hume had been making
inquiries as to Rousseau's pecuniary affairs. Perhaps, when he found a
man proclaiming his destitution to all Europe, and flinging back, in the
faces of the givers, the assistance his importunities extracted from the
compassionate, it was not a very great crime to endeavour to ascertain
the truth of any rumour, that the misery was not so extreme as the
sufferer painted it, and the necessity for their intervention not so
great as the compassionate believed it to be. There is one letter from
M. Rougemont among the MSS. R.S.E. dated 5th March, 1766. If it does not
contradict, it certainly does not confirm the theory of M. Musset. It is
too long and commonplace to be here inserted in full. There is not a
word in it about money matters; and it appears to be written in answer
to some high praise of Rousseau by Hume. The banker says:</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L'opinion que vous avez de M. Rousseau ne me laisse plus aucun doute:
et c'est avec la plus grande satisfaction que je vois que mon
enthusiasme ne m'a point aveuglée; les détails que vous me faites, me
persuadent encore plus de la vérité d'une observation que vous avez
faite un soir; c'est, qu'il n'est qu'un homme ordinaire quand son coeur
ne sent rien.</span>" MS. R.S.E.</p>

<p>One might indeed infer, that Hume's inquiries were to discover whether
the solitude of Wooton would be likely to be favourable to Rousseau. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M.
Rougemont</span> thinks it would not. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">La solitude</span>," he says, "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">qui peut cesser
quand on veut, peut avoir des charmes; mais je ne puis croire qu'il ne
soit pas fort malheureux d'être nécessairement privé de toute société</span>."
The rest of his letter is devoted to Parisian literary gossip, with
which the banker appears to have been ambitious of showing his
acquaintance.</p>

<p>It is not when reviewing the conduct of Hume, but when recalling such
observations as those made by Dr. Johnson on Rousseau, that one is
tempted to sympathize with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Musset</span>. Of the rigid moralist's opinions,
Boswell gives us the following sketch:</p>

<p>"One evening, at the Mitre, Johnson said sarcastically to me, 'It seems,
sir, you have kept very good company abroad: Rousseau and Wilkes!' I
answered, with a smile, 'My dear sir, you don't call Rousseau bad
company: do you really think <em>him</em> a bad man?' Johnson. 'Sir, if you are
talking jestingly of this, I don't talk with you. If you mean to be
serious, I think him one of the worst of men; a rascal who ought to be
hunted out of society as he has been. Three or four nations have
expelled him; and it is a shame that he is protected in this country.
Rousseau, sir, is a very bad man. I would sooner sign a sentence for his
transportation, than that of any felon who has gone from the Old Bailey
these many years. Yes, I should like to have him work in the
plantations.'"&mdash;Boswell, vol. ii. p. 314, ed. 1835.</p>

kidnapped. The late Professor Walker remembered being asked by Lord Bute
to accompany Rousseau on a botanizing excursion on the banks of the
Thames, and that he was just explaining something about marine plants
being acrid, when a Cockney pic-nic party of youths, dressed as sailors,
landed. Rousseau instantly took to his heels! The professor being
responsible for his safe restoration, followed, and, after a
considerable chase, succeeded in running him down. Rousseau, seeing that
there were no other pursuers, passed the matter off by the observation
that marine <em>men</em> were acrid. After his return from England, an account
for nine francs, which it appears he was not due, was presented against
him by a tradesman. He called on all Europe to witness this conspiracy
to destroy his character, and raised such an outcry as must have
effectually frightened sober tradesmen from overcharging interesting
solitaries.</p>

received public honours at Parma. After strenuous popular opposition, he
had been permitted to practise the new precautionary remedy of
inoculation on the young prince Ferdinand. The experiment had been
successful; all Parma, excited by loyal joy, petitioned the Grand-duke
to admit the physician to the rank of citizen. A tablet, commemorating
the triumph of science, was erected in the town hall, and a medal with
suitable devices was struck in honour of the operator. He was a relation

of the periodicals of the day, is really a pretty accurate abridgment of
Rousseau's paper. It has the appearance of having been written by a
Scottish lawyer:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqfn">
<p class="center"><i>Heads of an Indictment laid by J. J. Rousseau, philosopher, against D.
Hume, Esq.</i></p>

<p>1. That the said David Hume, to the great scandal of
philosophy, and not having the fitness of things before his
eyes, did concert a plan with Mess. Tronchin, Voltaire, and
D'Alembert, to ruin the said J. J. Rousseau for ever, by
bringing him over to England, and there settling him to his
heart's content.</p>

<p>2. That the said David Hume did, with a malicious and
traitorous intent, procure, or cause to be procured, by
himself, or somebody else, one pension of the yearly value of
£100 or thereabouts, to be paid to the said J. J. Rousseau, on
account of his being a philosopher, either privately or
publicly, as to him the said J. J. Rousseau should seem meet.</p>

<p>3. That the said David Hume did, one night after he left
Paris, put the said J. J. Rousseau in bodily fear, by talking
in his sleep; although the said J. J. Rousseau doth not know
whether the said David Hume was really asleep, or whether he
shammed Abraham, or what he meant.</p>

<p>4. That, at another time, as the said David Hume and the said
J. J. Rousseau were sitting opposite each other by the
fireside in London, he, the said David Hume, did look at him,
the said J. J. Rousseau, in a manner of which it is difficult
to give any idea: That he, the said J. J. Rousseau, to get rid
of the embarrassment he was under, endeavoured to look full at
him, the said David Hume, in return, to try if he could not
stare him out of countenance; but in fixing his eyes against
his, the said David Hume's, he felt the most inexpressible
terror, and was obliged to turn them away, insomuch that the
said J. J. Rousseau doth in his heart think and believe, as
much as he believes any thing, that he, the said David Hume,
is a certain composition of a white-witch and a rattlesnake.</p>

<p>5. That the said David Hume on the same evening, after
politely returning the embraces of him, the said J. J.
Rousseau, and gently tapping him on the back, did repeat
several times, in a good-natured easy tone, the words, "Why,
what, my dear sir! Nay, my dear sir! Oh, my dear sir!" From
whence the said J. J. Rousseau doth conclude, as he thinks
upon solid and sufficient grounds, that he the said David Hume
is a traitor; albeit he, the said J. J. Rousseau, doth
acknowledge, that the physiognomy of the good David is that of
an honest man, all but those terrible eyes of his, which he
must have borrowed; but he the said J. J. Rousseau vows to God
he cannot conceive from whom or what.</p>

<p>6. That the said David Hume hath more inquisitiveness about
him than becometh a philosopher, and did never let slip an
opportunity of being alone with the governante of him the said
J. J. Rousseau.</p>

<p>7. That the said David Hume did most atrociously and
flagitiously put him, the said J. J. Rousseau, philosopher,
into a passion; as knowing that then he would be guilty of a
number of absurdities.</p>

<p>8. That the said David Hume must have published Mr. Walpole's
letter in the newspapers, because, at that time, there was
neither man, woman, nor child, in the island of Great Britain,
but the said David Hume, the said J. J. Rousseau, and the
printers of the several newspapers aforesaid.</p>

<p>9. That somebody in a certain magazine, and somebody else in a
certain newspaper, said something against him, the said John
James Rousseau, which he, the said J. J. Rousseau, is
persuaded, for the reason abovementioned, could be nobody but
the said David Hume.</p>

<p>10. That the said J. J. Rousseau knows, that he, the said
David Hume, did open and peruse the letters of him, the said
J. J. Rousseau, because he one day saw the said David Hume go
out of the room, after his own servant, who had, at that time,
a letter of the said J. J. Rousseau's in his hands; which
<em>must</em> have been in order to take it from the servant, open
it, and read the contents.</p>

<p>11. That the said David Hume did, at the instigation of the
devil, in a most wicked and unnatural manner, send, or cause
to be sent, to the lodgings of him, the said J. J. Rousseau,
one dish of beefsteaks, thereby meaning to insinuate, that he,
the said J. J. Rousseau, was a beggar, and came over to
England to ask alms: whereas be it known to all men by these
presents, that he, the said John James Rousseau, brought with
him the means of subsistence, and did not come with an empty
purse; as he doubts not but he can live upon his labours&mdash;with
the assistance of his friends; and in short can do better
without the said David Hume than with him.</p>

<p>12. That besides all these facts put together, the said J. J.
Rousseau did not like a certain appearance of things on the
whole.</p>

IX. Lord Brougham twice honoured me with an intimation that he had
obtained letters of David Hume, in Paris, which were too late for his
own "Lives of Men of Letters," and were to be sent to <em>me</em>. While

<p class="letterdateit" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"A Paris, le 7 Septembre, 1766.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">J'ai trouvé ici, monsieur, votre lettre de 5 Août, à mon retour d'un
voyage que j'ai été faire en Normandie. D'Alembert, qui venoit alors de
recevoir votre récit de l'Histoire de Rousseau avec les lettres que vous
y avez insérées, me l'a communiqué. Je vous crois à présent si ennuyé de
cette affaire que je ne sais si je dois encore vous en parler. M. De
Montigni m'a cependant dit que vous désiriez de savoir ma façon de
penser. Vous imaginez bien qu'elle ne peut pas être douteuse sur le fond
de l'affaire, et je crois qu'excepté Rousseau, et peut-être M<sup>lle.</sup> Le
Vasseur, il n'y a personne dans le monde qui s'imagine, ni qui eut
jamais imaginé, que vous ayez mené Rousseau en Angleterre pour le
trahir, et à qui sa longue lettre et ses démonstrations ne fassent
pitié. Mais je vous avoue que j'y vois toujours plus de folie que de
noirceur. J'y vois des sophismes dont une imagination se sert pour
empoisonner les circonstances les plus simples et les transformer au gré
de la manie qui l'occupe. Mais je ne crois point que ces extravagances
soient un jeu joué, et un prétexte pour secouer le poids de la
reconnoissance qu'il vous doit. Il paroît sentir lui même que personne
ne le croira, et qu'il se couvre d'opprobre du moins pour le moment aux
yeux du public. Il avoue qu'il sacrifie et son intérêt et même sa
réputation: et il est certain que cette affaire lui fait un tort
irréparable, l'isole du genre humain, et lui ôte tout appui contre les
persécutions auxquelles ses opinions et encore plus ces traits de sa
misanthropie l'exposeront toujours. Je persiste donc à ne le croire que
fou, et je suis affligé que l'impression trop vive qu'a faite sur vous
sa folie vous ait mis dans le cas de la faire éclater et de la rendre
irrémédiable; car le bruit qu'à fait votre lettre au Baron, est pour
Rousseau une démonstration que ces conjectures étoient fondées sur la
vérité même. Il a bien mandé à Madame de Boufflers qu'il ne se plaignoit
pas, et que cette lettre qui vous a donné lieu de le diffamer comme le
dernier des hommes n'étoit écrite qu'à vous. L'éclat que vous avez fait,
lui a fait tout le mal possible, et sa lettre ne vous en a fait
aucun.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Après vous avoir dit aussi franchement mon avis, vous
serez surpris peut-être de me voir presque revenu à l'avis de faire
imprimer. La folie de Rousseau est telle qu'il a écrit ici différentes
lettres dans lesquelles il regarde votre trahison comme si constante, et
les démonstrations comme si terrassantes pour vous, qu'il vous défie de
publier les pièces sans vous déshonorer, à moins que vous ne les
falsifiez; ce ne sont pas ses termes mais c'en est le sens. Si cette
espèce de défi devenoit public à un certain point, et faisoit plus
d'impression en Angleterre qu'il n'en peut faire en France, peut-être
serez-vous obligé d'imprimer. Mais en ce cas je voudrois retrancher tout
réçit, toute imputation de mensonge, toutes notes excepté quelques unes
nécessaires pour rétablir simplement les faits importans, comme celui de
la scène qui s'est passée la veille de son départ pour Wooton. Encore
voudrois-je que dans ces notes vous disiez simplement le fait, sans
traiter Rousseau de menteur, sans vous abaisser à le prouver. Vous devez
être cru sur ce que vous direz, et vous le serez. Je ne mettrois autre
chose à la tête, si non que les discours répandus sur la querelle, &amp;c.
et l'espèce de défi que M. Rousseau vous fait d'en publier ce qui s'est
passé, vous obligent à regret à publier les accusations de M. Rousseau
contre vous, et que vous croyez leur publication une réponse suffisante.
Voilà quel est actuellement mon penchant. Mais comme je ne vois à cela
rien de pressé, je crois que vous ferez bien de vous donner tout le tems
d'y réfléchir. Plus vous mettez dans cette affaire de modération et même
d'indifférence, plus le tort de Rousseau deviendra évident.</span>"&mdash;MS.

aprés la sienne: que dans le 1<sup>er</sup> cas, comme vous l'observez
vous-même, personne ne pourra vous justifier; que dans le second, votre
défense seroit sans force; que vous avez donc cru devoir donner vous
même toute cette histoire au public, afin que Mr. Rousseau réponde s'il
le peut. Ensuite vous entrerez dans le détail, et dans le plus grand
détail, mais surtout, et c'est une chose absolument essentielle et que
nous vous recommendons tous&mdash;vous vous bornerez aux faits, exprimés
simplement et nettement, sans aigreur, sans la moindre injure, sans même
de réflexions sur le caractère de Rousseau et sur ses écrits; vous
rapporterez vos lettres et les siennes; celle qu'il vous a écrite le 23
juin suffiroit seule pour le faire condamner, vous ne direz point, du
moins trop souvent, que vous êtes son bienfaiteur&mdash;tout le monde le sait

Hume says, writing to Madame de Barbantane, "The King and Queen of
England expressed a strong desire to see these papers, and I was obliged
to put them into their hands. They read them with avidity, and entertain
the same sentiments that must strike every one. The king's opinion
confirms me in the resolution not to give them to the public, unless I
be forced to it by some attack on the side of my adversary, which it

all the controversies since the days of Scaliger and Scioppius, of
Billingsgate memory? Why, they sleep in oblivion, till some Bayle drags
them out of their dust, and takes mighty pains to ascertain the date of
each author's death, which is of no more consequence to the world than
the day of his birth. Many a country squire quarrels with his neighbour
about game and manors, yet they never print their wrangles, though as
much abuse passes between them, as if they could quote all the
Philippics of the learned." We have an instance of what he considered a
really important dispute, when he was baffled in his attempt to get his
nephew, Lord Orford, married to Miss Nicol, "the vast fortune." "Thus,"
he says, "had I placed him in a greater situation than even his
grandfather hoped to bequeath to him,&mdash;had retrieved all the oversights
of my family,&mdash;had saved Houghton, and all our glory." "I have been
forced," he says, writing to Horace Mann, "<em>to write a narrative</em> of the
whole transaction; and was with difficulty kept from publishing
it."&mdash;<cite>Letters</cite> , ii. 401.</p>

publication of his pamphlet, for again expressing his contempt of men
whose sole claim to notice rested on the greatness of their genius: "For
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur D'Alembert</span>," he says, "I said that I was mighty indifferent
about seeing him. That it was not my custom to seek authors, who are a
conceited troublesome set of people." And hearing that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fréron</span>, the same
who was so sharp a thorn in Voltaire's side, had made some remarks on
him, which displeased the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Duchesse de Choiseul</span>, he says, "I immediately
wrote to Paris, to beg the duchess would suffer <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Fréron</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span>,
or any of the tribe, to write what they pleased, to get what money they
could by abusing me."</p>

not nearly so numerous as those published in France. Fuseli, whose mind
was well suited for such a paradoxical championship, wrote "A defence of
M. Rousseau, against the Aspersions of Mr. Hume, Monsieur Voltaire, and
their associates." The other pamphlet alluded to in the letter, was,
perhaps, "A letter to the Honourable Horace Walpole, concerning the
dispute between Mr. Hume and M. Rousseau," by the Rev. Ralph Heathcote,
D.D. Hume says, in a letter to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Madame de Boufflers</span>, "Agreeably to the
licence of this country, there has been a great deal of raillery on the
incident, thrown out in the public papers, but all against that unhappy
man. There is even a print engraved of it: M. Rousseau is represented as
a Yahoo, newly caught in the woods; I am represented as a farmer, who
caresses him and offers him some oats to eat, which he refuses in a
rage; Voltaire and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> are whipping him up behind; and Horace
Walpole making him horns of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">papier mâché</i>. The idea is not altogether

such matters was unrivalled, seems to have at least made a near approach
to the discovery of this point. He says in his narration, "The chief
cause of his disgust has been a long quarrel between his housekeeper and
Mr. Davenport's cook-maid, who, as Rousseau affirmed, had always dressed
their dinner very ill, and at last had sprinkled ashes on their

in Rousseau's Works, is "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">les plaintes indiscrettes, qui dans le fort de

probably between Rousseau's preserved copy, and the letter sent. That
this letter was printed from a copy preserved by Rousseau, is shown by
the editors of his Works not knowing to whom it was addressed. Hume
repeats his own version of the passage in a French letter already

</div>


<p class="section">The quarrel with Rousseau seems to have so fully occupied the attention
of Hume, during its continuance, that he scarcely alluded to any other
subject in his correspondence; and thus, though the preceding chapter is
devoted entirely to that event, a very slight retrospect from the point
of time reached at its conclusion, will suffice for whatever else,
worthy of notice in his life or correspondence, has been preserved.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1766, he made a short visit to Scotland. "I returned,"
he says, in his "own life," "to that place, not richer, but with much
more money, and a much larger income, by means of Lord Hertford's
friendship, than I left it; and I was desirous of trying what
superfluity could produce, as I had formerly made an experiment of a
competency. But, in 1767, I received, from Mr. Conway, an invitation to
be under-secretary; and this invitation, both the character of the
person, and my connexions with Lord Hertford, prevented me from
declining."</p>

<p>He was thus solicited to undertake the very responsible duties of this
office, by one who had good opportunities of knowing his capacity for
public business; and the simple fact of the appointment is a testimony
to the ability with which he had performed <!-- Page 383 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_383" id="Page_v2_383">[383]</a></span>the analogous functions of
his office in France. He was indeed at all times a man of punctual
habits, and his unwearied industry had not yet begun to slacken. He had
a mind of that clear systematic order which was well fitted for the
composition of official documents; and his triumphs in philosophical and
historical literature never inflated him with the ambition of
considering any business which he consented to undertake too
insignificant to deserve his full attention. Some official documents,
connected with the successive offices which he held, have been
preserved, by collectors, as autographs of so celebrated a man: and they
generally arrest the attention of every one who examines them, by the
clearness and precision of the language, and not a little by the
neatness of the handwriting.</p>

<p>After the resignation of the Marquis of Tweeddale, in 1746, there was no
longer a principal secretary of state for Scotland; and it became usual
to consult the Lord Advocate, or any other ministerial officer, locally
connected with the north, as to the policy to be pursued in Scottish
affairs. None of the principal members of the Grafton ministry were
Scotsmen; and there can be little doubt that Hume must then have
exercised a large influence in all affairs connected with his native
country.<a name="FNanchor_383:1_336" id="FNanchor_383:1_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_383:1_336" class="fnanchor">[383:1]</a> He held his office until the 20th <!-- Page 384 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_384" id="Page_v2_384">[384]</a></span>of July 1768, when
General Conway was superseded by Lord Weymouth.</p>

<p>The following letter contains a brief sketch of the general current of
his official life.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"1st April, 1767.</p>

<p>"My way of life here is very uniform, and by no means
disagreeable. I pass all the forenoon in the secretary's
house, from ten till three, where there arrive, from time to
time, messengers, that bring me <!-- Page 385 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_385" id="Page_v2_385">[385]</a></span>all the secrets of the
kingdom, and, indeed, of Europe, Asia, Africa, and America. I
am seldom hurried; but have leisure, at intervals, to take up
a book, or write a private letter, or converse with any friend
that may call for me; and from dinner to bed-time is all my
own. If you add to this, that the person with whom I have the
chief, if not only transactions, is the most reasonable, equal
tempered, and gentleman-like man imaginable, and Lady
Aylesbury the same, you will certainly think I have no reason
to complain; and I am far from complaining. I only shall not
regret when my duty is over; because, to me, the situation can
lead to nothing, at least in all probability; and reading, and
sauntering, and lounging, and dosing, which I call thinking,
is my supreme happiness. I mean my full contentment.</p>

<p>"I thank you for the acquaintance you offer me of Mr. Percy;
but it would be impracticable for me to cultivate his
friendship, as men of letters have here no place of
rendezvous; and are, indeed, sunk and forgot in the general
torrent of the world. If you can therefore decline, without
hardship, any letter of recommendation, it would save trouble
both to him and me."<a name="FNanchor_385:1_338" id="FNanchor_385:1_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_385:1_338" class="fnanchor">[385:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>In the beginning of the year 1767, Ferguson published his "Essay on the
History of Civil Society," a work which speedily acquired a wide
reputation through Europe. The allusions which Hume has been found
making to some work of a similar character, so early as 1759,<a name="FNanchor_385:2_339" id="FNanchor_385:2_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_385:2_339" class="fnanchor">[385:2]</a>
probably refer to a particular portion of this book. Immediately before
its publication, he recommended Ferguson's friends to prevail on him to
suppress the work, as likely to be injurious to its author's literary
reputation: one of the few <!-- Page 386 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_386" id="Page_v2_386">[386]</a></span>instances, if it be not the only one, in
which he discouraged a fellow-countryman, desirous of casting his lot
into the competition for literary distinction. He ultimately found that
his advice was erroneous, as the book soon obtained a high character.
But, had his own opinion of its merits coincided with the suffrages of
the public, it would not have been so honourable to his memory, as the
satisfaction he expressed on the discovery that the verdict of the
reading world was against him. Writing to Blair on 24th February, 1767,
he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I happened yesterday to visit a person three hours after a copy of
Ferguson's performance was opened, for the first time, in London. It was
by Lord Mansfield. I accept this omen of its future success. He was
extremely pleased with it; said it was very agreeable, and perfectly
well wrote; assured me that he would not stop a moment till he had
finished it; and recommended it strongly to the perusal of the
Archbishop of York, who was present. I have wrote the same article of
intelligence to Ferguson himself; but as he is the likeliest person in
the world to suppress it, I thought it safest to put it into your hands,
in order to circulate it."<a name="FNanchor_386:1_340" id="FNanchor_386:1_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:1_340" class="fnanchor">[386:1]</a></p>

<p>Again:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I hear good things said of Ferguson's book every day. Lord Holderness
showed me a letter from the Archbishop of York, where his Grace says,
that in many things it surpasses Montesquieu. My friend, Mr. Dodwell,
says that it is an admirable book, elegantly wrote, and with great
purity of language. Pray, tell to Ferguson and to others all these
things."<a name="FNanchor_386:2_341" id="FNanchor_386:2_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_386:2_341" class="fnanchor">[386:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 387 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_387" id="Page_v2_387">[387]</a></span>Again, writing to the same correspondent, on 1st April, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The success of the book, dear Doctor, which you mention, gives me great
satisfaction, on account of my sincere friendship for the author; and so
much the rather, as the success was to me unexpected. I have since begun
to hope, and even to believe, that I was mistaken; and in this
persuasion have several times taken it up and read chapters of it. But,
to my great mortification and sorrow, I have not been able to change my
sentiments. We shall see, by the duration of its fame, whether or not I
am mistaken. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Helvétius</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saurin</span> both told me at Paris, that they had
been consulted by <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montesquieu</span> about his '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit des Loix</span>.' They used the
freedom to tell him, as their fixed opinion, that he ought to suppress
the book; which they foresaw would very much injure his reputation. They
said to me that, no doubt, I thought they had reason to be ashamed of
their judgment. But still, added they, you may observe that the public
are very much returned from their first admiration of that book; and we
are persuaded that they will daily return still more.</p>

<p>"I hope that I shall be found a false prophet as much as these
gentlemen; for though the '<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Esprit des Loix</span>,' be considerably sunk in
vogue, and will probably still sink farther, it maintains a high
reputation, and probably will never be totally neglected. It has
considerable merit, notwithstanding the glare of its pointed wit, and
notwithstanding its false refinements, and its rash and crude positions.
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Helvétius</span> and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Saurin</span> assured me, that this freedom of theirs never lost
them any thing of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Montesquieu's</span> friendship. I believe the like would be
my case; but it is better not <!-- Page 388 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_388" id="Page_v2_388">[388]</a></span>to put it to a trial. On that account, as
well as others, I recommend to you secrecy, towards every person except
Robertson."<a name="FNanchor_388:1_342" id="FNanchor_388:1_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:1_342" class="fnanchor">[388:1]</a></p>

<p>A letter from Adam Smith, desiring that his friend, Count Sarsfield,
might be introduced to Hume's circle of acquaintance, called forth the
following narrative of a very amusing incident:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 13th June, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;The Count de Sarsfield is a good acquaintance of
mine, from the time I saw him at Paris; and as he is really a
man of merit, I have great pleasure whenever I meet him here.
My occupations keep me from cultivating his friendship as much
as I should incline. I did not introduce him to Elliot,
because I knew that this gentleman's reserve and indolence
would make him neglect the acquaintance; and I did not
introduce him to Oswald, because I fear that he and I are
broke for ever; at least he does not seem inclined to take any
steps towards an accommodation with me.</p>

<p>"I am to tell you the strangest story you ever heard of. I was
dining with him, above two months ago, where, among other
company, was the Bishop of Raphoe.<a name="FNanchor_388:2_343" id="FNanchor_388:2_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_388:2_343" class="fnanchor">[388:2]</a> After dinner we were
disposed to be merry. I said to the company, that I had been
very ill used by Lord Hertford; for that I always expected to
be made a bishop by him during his lieutenancy! but he had
given away two sees from me, to my great vexation and
disappointment. The right reverend, without any farther
provocation, burst out into the <!-- Page 389 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_389" id="Page_v2_389">[389]</a></span>most furious, and indecent,
and orthodox rage that ever was seen: told me that I was most
impertinent; that if he did not wear a gown, I durst not, no,
I durst not, have used him so; that none but a coward would
treat a clergyman in that manner; that henceforth he must
either abstain from his brother's house, or I must; and that
this was not the first time he had heard the stupid joke from
my mouth. With the utmost tranquillity and temper I asked his
pardon; assured him, upon my honour, that I did not mean him
the least offence: if I had imagined he could possibly have
been displeased, I never should have mentioned the subject;
but the joke was not in the least against him, but entirely
against myself, as if I were capable of such an expectation as
that of being a bishop! my regard for himself, and still more
for his brother, with whom I had long been more particularly
connected, would certainly restrain me from either joke or
earnest, which could be offensive to him; and that, if I had
ever touched on the same topic before, I had entirely forgot
it, and it must have been above a twelvemonth ago. He was
nowise appeased; raved on in the same style for a long time.
At last I got the discourse diverted, and took my leave,
seemingly with great indifference and even good humour. I was
nowise surprised nor concerned about his lordship; because I
had, on other occasions, observed the same orthodox zeal swell
within him, and it was often difficult for him to converse
with temper when I was in the company.</p>

<p>"But what really surprised and vexed me was, that his brother
kept silence all the time. I met him in the passage when I
went away, and he made me no apology. He has never since
called on me; and though he sees that I never come near his
house, <!-- Page 390 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_390" id="Page_v2_390">[390]</a></span>though formerly I used to be three or four times
a-week with him, he never takes the least notice of it. I own
this gives me vexation, because I have a sincere value and
affection for him. It is only some satisfaction to me to find,
that I am so palpably in the right as not to leave the least
room for doubt or ambiguity. Dr. Pitcairne, who was in the
company, says that he never saw such a scene in his lifetime.
If I were sure, dear Smith, that you and I should not some day
quarrel in some such manner, I should tell you that I am,
yours very affectionately and sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_390:1_344" id="FNanchor_390:1_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_390:1_344" class="fnanchor">[390:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The world levies certain penalties on the enjoyment of a character for
good nature and kindness, and Hume seems to have paid them to their most
ample extent, in the shape of executing commissions, and performing
general petty services for his friends. We have witnessed the zeal with
which he attended to the education of Mr. Elliot's two sons. A teacher
of languages, possessing the distinguished name of Graffigny, and
professing to be in the confidence of celebrated literary people in
Paris, appears to have excited the suspicion of Baron Mure, whose sons
he was employed to instruct. Hume undertook to make some inquiries
regarding him; and his brief reports, from time to time, have some
interest from their containing a few of his opinions on education.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Baron Mure</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 1st July, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;I believe I told you, that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert</span> disclaimed
all sort of acquaintance with him. I have this moment received
a letter from <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Helvétius</span>, <!-- Page 391 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_391" id="Page_v2_391">[391]</a></span>doing the same. It was in answer to
one I wrote him at Lord Hertford's desire. I know not from
what quarter we had heard that he had given to Lord Harcourt,
or Lord Newnam, a good character of Graffigny: but it must
have been a mistake; for to me he says, that he knows no such
man; that his wife, who was niece to the famous Ma<sup>me</sup> de
Graffigny, and educated with her, never saw or heard of such a
man: nor can they imagine who he may be. After this second
imposture, it is certain that Lord Hertford will not put his
sons to him; nor do I think it fit yours should longer remain.
He is an empty, conceited fellow, full of chimeras and
pretensions; and I think you are at no great loss for parting
with him. The question [is,] what to do next?"</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdate">(<i>Undated.</i>)</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;He is indeed a conceited man, full of whimseys
and affectations, reasoning always in the clouds about the
most obvious things, and hunting after novelties and
singularities of which his genius is incapable. What, for
instance, can be more whimsical than his method of teaching
Latin? He gives his boys a long list of words, which they are
to get by heart, like the muster-roll of a regiment, and a
great heap of grammar rules, which are to them unintelligible.
After he has laid this foundation of a language, as he
imagines, he begins them with the most difficult of all the
Latin poets; and for this plan of education, he will give you
a galimatias of reasons, clothed in the smoothest language,
and delivered with the softest accent."</p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdate">(<i>Undated.</i>)</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;In my conversation with your young folks
yesterday, I endeavoured to inform myself concerning their
progress in Latin. I find that they <!-- Page 392 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_392" id="Page_v2_392">[392]</a></span>are not taught any Latin
grammar; they are only instructed in the sense of single
detached words, which they learn, both in Greek and Latin, at
once. Accordingly they told me water, aqua, and <ins class="greek" title="hudôr" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">υδωρ</ins>;
but though I tried them in about half a dozen more words, I
could not find their learning extended so far. All this
appears to me very whimsical; and I doubt a dead language can
never be learned in this manner without grammar. In a living
language, the continual application of the words and phrases
teaches at the same time the sense of the words, and their
reference to each other; but a list of words got by heart,
without any connected sense, easily escapes the memory, and is
but a small part of the language."<a name="FNanchor_392:1_345" id="FNanchor_392:1_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:1_345" class="fnanchor">[392:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>There are several indications that Hume still retained the half-formed
intention of continuing his History through a portion of the period
succeeding the Revolution. In a brief undated letter, written to Smith
in Paris, he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some push me to continue my History. Millar offers me any price. All
the Marlborough papers are offered me: and I believe nobody would
venture to refuse me. But <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">cui bono</i>? Why should I forego idleness, and
sauntering, and society, and expose myself again to the clamours of a
stupid factious public? I am not yet tired of doing nothing; and am
become too wise either to mind censure or applause. By and bye I shall
be too old to undergo so much labour. Adieu."<a name="FNanchor_392:2_346" id="FNanchor_392:2_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_392:2_346" class="fnanchor">[392:2]</a></p>

<p>Smith's opinion is thus reported by Andrew Millar, on 22d November,
1766.</p>

<p>"He is of opinion, with many more of your very <!-- Page 393 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_393" id="Page_v2_393">[393]</a></span>good sensible friends,
that the History of this country, from the Revolution, is not to be met
with in books yet printed; but from MSS. in this country, to which he is
sure you will have ready access, from all accounts he hears from the
great here; and therefore you should lay the ground-work here, after
your perusal of the MSS. you may have access to, and doing it below will
be laying the wrong foundation. I think it my duty to inform you the
opinion of your most judicious friends, and I think he and Sir John
Pringle may be reckoned amongst that number."<a name="FNanchor_393:1_347" id="FNanchor_393:1_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_393:1_347" class="fnanchor">[393:1]</a></p>

<p>Millar, indeed, seems to have scarcely ever relaxed from urging this
project; and perhaps it was his perseverance, and not any
self-originating desire to pursue the task, that kept the design alive
in Hume's mind. He had written to his worthy publisher on 8th October,
1766:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall probably do as you advise, and sketch out the outlines of the
two or three subsequent reigns, which I may finish at London, after I
find that there remains no farther obstacles to this work, and that it
is favoured, I do not say by every body, (for that is impossible,) but
by the generality of the world."</p>

<p>At a later date he thus expressed his views:&mdash;</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Andrew Millar</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 17th July, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;We are still in as unsettled a condition as when
you left us. There will certainly be a considerable alteration
in the ministry; and I do not at present reckon my principal's
situation more precarious than that of any other minister. He
speaks, however, like a man who is to be out of office <!-- Page 394 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_394" id="Page_v2_394">[394]</a></span>in a
few days. I have also taken the precaution to desire him to
request of the king, in my name, the liberty, after my
dismission, of inspecting all the public records, and all the
papers in the Paper-office. His majesty was pleased to say,
that he very willingly complied with my request, and was glad
to hear of my intentions. But my chief view is to run over
such papers as belong to the period which I have already
wrote, in order to render that part of my History as little
imperfect as possible. It would be folly to think of writing
any more; and even as to correcting, were it not an amusement,
to what purpose would it serve, since I shall certainly never
live to see a new edition?"<a name="FNanchor_394:1_348" id="FNanchor_394:1_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_394:1_348" class="fnanchor">[394:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On the same subject, and in the same tone, he writes to his brother, on
6th October:&mdash;</p>

<p>"As to myself, I pass my time, as I told you, in an agreeable enough
kind of business, and not too much of it. My income, also, is at present
very considerable&mdash;above £1100 a-year, of which I shall not spend much
above the half. Notwithstanding, I sometimes wish to be out of
employment, in order to prosecute my History, to which every body urges
me. When Mr. Conway was on the point of resigning, I desired him to
propose to the king that I might afterwards have the liberty of
inspecting all the public offices for such papers as might serve to my
purpose. His majesty said, that he was glad that I had that object in my
eye; and I should certainly have all the assistance in his power. He was
also pleased, some time after, to send to me the Baron Behr, minister
for Hanover, to tell me that he had ordered over some papers from
Hanover, to be put into my hands, because he believed <!-- Page 395 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_395" id="Page_v2_395">[395]</a></span>they would be of
use to me. I believe I have told you that the use of the Marlborough
papers had been promised me by Lord and Lady Spencer; but Marchmont, who
had some pretence of authority over them, as trustee, delayed giving
them up, suspecting, I suppose, the use they intended to make of
them."<a name="FNanchor_395:1_349" id="FNanchor_395:1_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_395:1_349" class="fnanchor">[395:1]</a></p>

<p>Though it was as part of Lord Rockingham's administration that Conway
became secretary of state, and his political connexions attached him to
that leader, he had been prevailed on to retain office on the formation
of the Grafton and Chatham cabinet, in August 1766. In the summer of
1767, that ministry seemed likely to be formidably assailed by the
united efforts of the Rockingham and Bedford parties, whose meetings and
resolutions at Newcastle House are matters well known in history.
General Conway's resignation would have terminated Hume's tenure of
office; and we find, in his correspondence, a few indications of
interest in the political movements of the time; yet so calm and
modified, that even the possession of office seems scarcely to have
affected the stoic philosophy with which he contemplated ministerial
revolutions.</p>

<p>He says to his friend Blair, on the 18th of June:&mdash;</p>

<p>"We are all again in confusion. Negotiations for a new ministry; the
fatal month of July approaching; a new settlement to be made, which will
be no settlement. I fancy I return, in a few weeks, to my former
situation."<a name="FNanchor_395:2_350" id="FNanchor_395:2_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_395:2_350" class="fnanchor">[395:2]</a></p>

<p>And to Smith, on 14th July:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I send you the enclosed, with a large packet for Count
Sarsfield. This is the last ministerial act which I shall probably
perform; and with this exertion I finish my functions. I shall <!-- Page 396 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_396" id="Page_v2_396">[396]</a></span>not
leave this country presently. Perhaps I may go over to France. Our
resignation is a very extraordinary incident, and will probably occasion
a total change of ministry. Are you busy?"<a name="FNanchor_396:1_351" id="FNanchor_396:1_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_396:1_351" class="fnanchor">[396:1]</a></p>

<p>His official life, however, was not so near a conclusion as he thought
it was. The following letter is more full and explicit, in regard to
these matters:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 28th July, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;Were my present situation any object of anxiety, I
should have been very unhappy of late: so uncertain has my continuance
appeared every moment, and so near did my ministerial functions seem to
draw towards their conclusion. But as the matter was very nearly
indifferent to me, I neither felt anxiety for my past danger, nor do I
experience any joy from my present establishment; for we are now
established, for some time at least, and all apprehensions of a change
are removed to a distance. The history of our late transactions is, in
short, as follows: About this time twelvemonth, when the last revolution
of ministry took place, Mr. Conway staid in, though Lord Rockingham, and
most of his friends, were turned out: But it was with reluctance, and
only on the earnest entreaties of the king and Lord Chatham, and on
their giving him a promise that several of his friends and party should
still continue to hold their places. This engagement was broke last
winter. Some of these gentlemen were turned out; and Mr. Conway, after
protesting against this usage, declared, that though he would keep his
office during the session, not to disturb the king's business, he would
resign as soon as the parliament should rise. He accordingly desired the
king, about six weeks ago, <!-- Page 397 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_397" id="Page_v2_397">[397]</a></span>to provide him a successor, and was
entreated only to keep the seals till a proper person should be thought
of. When the matter came to be discussed, it was found very difficult.
The Duke of Grafton declared, that being deprived of Lord Chatham's
support, he could not continue to serve without Mr. Conway: and a total
dissolution of the ministry seemed to be the effect of the incident.
Negotiations were accordingly set on foot with the leaders of the
opposition, and a great meeting of them was held last week, at Bedford
House. It was found that they could not, by any means, agree in their
demands; and they separated in mutual discontent. Every body thinks that
Mr. Conway has now satisfied, to the full, the point of honour, in which
he is very scrupulous, and that he will cordially resume his functions,
especially as he stands so well with the king and his fellow ministers,
and has brought it within the choice of his old friends to accept of the
ministry, if they had thought proper. I was beginning to wish for our
dissolution; but upon this turn of affairs, I resume my occupations with
cheerfulness."<a name="FNanchor_397:1_352" id="FNanchor_397:1_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_397:1_352" class="fnanchor">[397:1]</a></p>

<p>The remainder of this letter is devoted to a matter in which we have
already frequently found him taking interest&mdash;the education of his
nephews. From his earliest to his latest days, his connexion with his
elder brother was cordial and affectionate. On the 6th of October we
find him writing, in a tone which indicates a sympathy with some
domestic calamity which his brother must have suffered:&mdash;</p>

<p>"The time of your going to Edinburgh approaches, which makes a great
change in your way of life, and will naturally make yourself, as well as
all your <!-- Page 398 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_398" id="Page_v2_398">[398]</a></span>friends, anxious about the issue of it. However, I cannot but
think that you will there live more cheerfully, with all your children
about you, than in the country, during the winter, when your boys were
absent. At first only, as your spirits are not very strong at present,
you may feel uneasy at the alteration, as you are at present somewhat
apprehensive about it."<a name="FNanchor_398:1_353" id="FNanchor_398:1_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_398:1_353" class="fnanchor">[398:1]</a></p>

<p>There was apparently but one point in which the two brothers differed;
and it was a subject on which Hume seems to have been at war with all
his clan. The Laird of Ninewells, notwithstanding all the lustre that
had now gathered round the name of <em>Hume</em>, would not adopt it in place
of that of <em>Home</em>, which his father had borne. He was a simple,
single-hearted man, moderate in all his views and wishes, and neither
ambitious of distinction nor of wealth. He passed his life as a retired
country gentleman; and while Europe was full of his brother's name, he
was so averse to notoriety, that he is known to have objected to the
domestic events of births, marriages, and deaths, in his family,
obtaining the usual publicity through the newspapers.<a name="FNanchor_398:2_354" id="FNanchor_398:2_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_398:2_354" class="fnanchor">[398:2]</a> His eldest
son, Joseph, frequently mentioned in the following correspondence,
succeeded him in his estate and retired habits, but not entirely in his
disposition; for he indulged in many of the eccentricities and
peculiarities so often exhibited by the Scottish gentry,&mdash;a
characteristic they seem to derive from the circumstance, that, in the
British empire, there is no person less liable to encounter an equal,
and to be thwarted in his small exercise of absolute power, than a
Scottish laird. It is evident from his uncle's letters, that Joseph
<!-- Page 399 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_399" id="Page_v2_399">[399]</a></span>obtained an excellent education. He was for some time placed under the
charge of poor Blacklock,&mdash;an arrangement by which Hume sought to
perform a double act of beneficence.<a name="FNanchor_399:1_355" id="FNanchor_399:1_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_399:1_355" class="fnanchor">[399:1]</a> Joseph died unmarried, <!-- Page 400 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_400" id="Page_v2_400">[400]</a></span>on
14th February, 1832, and was succeeded by his brother David, whose
career was more public and <!-- Page 401 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_401" id="Page_v2_401">[401]</a></span>distinguished. He was born on 27th February,
1757,<a name="FNanchor_401:1_356" id="FNanchor_401:1_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_401:1_356" class="fnanchor">[401:1]</a> and died on 27th July, 1838. He was successively sheriff of
the counties of Berwick and Linlithgow. He was professor of Scots law in
the university of Edinburgh, and a principal clerk of Session. He
subsequently resigned these offices, on his being appointed a Baron of
the Scottish Exchequer. His works are of great authority in the
practical departments of the law. While he taught in the university, his
students zealously collected notes of his lectures; and, as he refused
to permit any version of them to be published, the well preserved
collections of these notes have been considered valuable treasuries of
legal wisdom. In 1790, he published "Commentaries on the law of
Scotland, respecting trials for crimes;" and, in 1797, "Commentaries on
the law of Scotland respecting the description and punishment of
crimes," forming, in four quarto volumes, a comprehensive treatise on
all the departments of the criminal law of Scotland, which has now
passed through three editions. It has been justly remarked, that lawyers
of the <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_402" id="Page_v2_402">[402]</a></span>present generation, can, with difficulty, appreciate the merit
of this work, because, from its having converted the whole subject it
embraces into a system, the chaotic mass, from which the present
comparatively orderly criminal code of Scotland was constructed, has
disappeared.<a name="FNanchor_402:1_357" id="FNanchor_402:1_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_402:1_357" class="fnanchor">[402:1]</a></p>

<p>Few literary reputations have been more unlike each other than those of
the two David Humes, uncle and nephew. The former hated legal details
and the jargon of technical phraseology; to the latter they were the
breath of his literary life. The one, as a philosopher, saw, throughout
a wide circumference of vision, the relations to each other of the most
distant objects of human knowledge; the latter saw nothing beyond the
bounds of the professional details before him; but these he noted with
an unrivalled accuracy. The strength, clearness, and beauty of the
philosopher's language have been a lasting object of admiration; the
lawyer's diction was clumsy, rude, and ponderous, without being either
strong or clear. On one point only did they agree&mdash;their political
opinions; and yet, on this subject, they seem not always to have been in
unison. From a very curious letter, which will be found a few pages
farther on, it appears that Hume thought it necessary seriously to warn
his nephew against republican principles. Few, who are only acquainted
with the opinions of Baron Hume's later life, will be inclined to
believe that this danger could ever have been serious. He was a
supporter <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_403" id="Page_v2_403">[403]</a></span>of all those parts of the criminal law of Scotland,&mdash;in his
day not a few,&mdash;which put the subject at the mercy of the crown and of
the judges; and a warm admirer of his sagacity and learning, as a
lawyer, cannot quit this subject without regretting that these qualities
should have been brought to aid the promulgation of arbitrary
principles.</p>

<p>The education of his nephews, occupies, as has been already stated, the
remainder of the letter by Hume to his brother above cited.</p>

<p>"My present situation revives those reflections which have frequently
occurred to me concerning the education of your sons, particularly of
Josey, whose age now advances, and seems to approach towards a crisis.
The question is, whether he had better continue his education in
Scotland or in England. There are several advantages of a Scots
education; but the question is, whether that of the language does not
counterbalance them, and determine the preference to the English. He is
now of an age to learn it perfectly; but if a few years elapse, he may
acquire such an accent, as he will never be able to cure of. It is not
yet determined what profession he shall be of: but it must always be of
great advantage to speak properly: especially if it should prove, as we
have reason to hope, that his good parts will open him the road of
ambition. The only inconvenience is, that few Scotsmen, that have had an
English education, have ever settled cordially in their own country; and
they have been commonly lost ever after to their friends. However, as
this consequence is not necessary, the superior recommendations of an
English education ought not to be neglected. I have been making
inquiries for some time, and on the whole I find Eton the best place for
the education of youth. <!-- Page 404 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_404" id="Page_v2_404">[404]</a></span>He would there be able to form connexions with
many young people of distinction; though the whole expense would
scarcely exceed £70 a-year, which I fancy is little more than he costs
you at present. I suggest, therefore, this idea to you that you may
weigh it at leisure, and determine upon it. I know you do not like to be
hurried, and therefore the more time for reflection the better. His
friend and companion, young Adam, is coming up soon, but is going to
Westminster school, which is a place that I find some objections to.</p>

<p>"I hope Mrs. Home is perfectly recovered. I am glad to hear such good
news of Jock. I had a letter from Davie last week, which gave me
pleasure. I am, dear brother, yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_404:1_358" id="FNanchor_404:1_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_404:1_358" class="fnanchor">[404:1]</a></p>

<p>On 13th October, in a letter of which a portion has been cited above,
Hume writes further on the same subject:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Brother</span>,&mdash;I never prognosticated well of Josey's genius for the
mathematics, from his great slowness in learning arithmetic: and I am
not surprised to find that his progress in Euclid has not been so great
as might have been expected from his quickness and his capacity in other
particulars. There is indeed something very unaccountable in his turn;
so childish in many cases, and yet so manly, and quick, and sensible in
others. The presence of strangers, above all, seems to make him
recollect himself, and he is exceedingly taking among them. His address
in particular, is remarkably good, and he seems to have a turn for the
world and for company. However, I do not think him by any means
deficient in his talents for literature. It appeared to me that he
<!-- Page 405 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_405" id="Page_v2_405">[405]</a></span>always read his books with a very good taste, Latin as well as French
and English; and I imagine that he will make at least a very
gentlemanlike scholar. I wish therefore he had a further trial of the
Greek; and if that will not do, I think with you that the Italian is an
easy and genteel acquisition, which will furnish him with occupation for
this winter."<a name="FNanchor_405:1_359" id="FNanchor_405:1_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_405:1_359" class="fnanchor">[405:1]</a></p>

<p>Hume expressed no high respect for the historical abilities of Dr.
Smollett, nor could he have well expected credit for sincerity if he had
done so. With the works in which the novelist let loose his native
genius, it is not likely that the philosopher could have had much
sympathy. But two letters addressed by him to Smollett, show that the
successful and affluent man of letters was substantially kind and
friendly to his less fortunate countryman.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Tobias Smollett</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, July 18, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I have had a conversation with Lord Shelburne
concerning your affairs: he told me that he had long been
pre-engaged for the consulship of Nice to the Spanish
ambassador, and could not possibly get free of that
obligation. I then mentioned the consulship of Leghorn; but he
said he was <!-- Page 406 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_406" id="Page_v2_406">[406]</a></span>already engaged for that office to a friend of
Mr. Dunning, the lawyer. On the whole, I cannot flatter you
with any hopes of success from that quarter; even supposing
his lordship were to remain in office, which is very
uncertain, considering the present state of our ministry. For
of all our annual confusions, the present seems to be the most
violent, and to threaten the most entire revolution, and the
most important events. As Lord Chatham's state of health
appears totally desperate, and as Lord Shelburne's connexion
is supposed to be chiefly, if not solely, with him, many
people foretell a short duration to the greatness of the last
named minister. Every thing is uncertain: there is a mighty
combination to overpower the king. The force of the crown is
great; but is not employed with that steadiness which its
friends would wish. I pretend not to foresee, much less to
foretell, the consequences. I am, dear sir, your most
obedient, and most humble servant," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_406:1_360" id="FNanchor_406:1_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:1_360" class="fnanchor">[406:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>It has been a matter of speculation, if not of dispute among
ecclesiastical politicians, how far Hume had an influence in the
dispensation of church patronage in Scotland. The following letters,
having however a more immediate reference to state politics, may be held
to afford some light on this question.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert Elliot</span>.<a name="FNanchor_406:2_361" id="FNanchor_406:2_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_406:2_361" class="fnanchor">[406:2]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 13th August, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Gilbert</span>,&mdash;I am told that the minister of Kirkton, in
the Presbytery of Jedburgh, is either dying, or is to be
removed, and that the living is in the <!-- Page 407 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_407" id="Page_v2_407">[407]</a></span>gift of the crown. I
have spoke to General Conway desiring that, in case no
unexpected difficulties occur, he may give it to my nephew's
tutor; and he has agreed to it. I have since heard, that the
living, though it stands in our list as a crown presentation,
is alternately in the gift of Sir John Elliot of Stobs, and
Cavers Douglas. I shall be much obliged to you, if, without
mentioning the reason, you could make inquiries, and give me
information.</p>

<p>"You have heard, no doubt, that all our negotiations have
vanished, and that our present ministry is settled on a firmer
basis than ever. Mr. Conway's delicacy of honour was
satisfied, by bringing his old friends the Rockinghams to have
an offer; and as it was impossible for them to concert a
ministry, he has agreed to act cordially with the Duke of
Grafton: the king is very happy that no changes are to have
place. I do not reckon the change in Ireland for any thing,
because Lord Bristol goes out at his own earnest and repeated
desire. I am told that Lord Townsend openly ascribes his own
promotion entirely to the friendship of Lord Bute. Charles
Fitzroy lately, in a great meeting, proposed Lord Bute's
health in a bumper. It will be a surprise to you certainly, if
that noble lord should again come into fashion, and openly
avow his share of influence, and be openly courted by all the
world. I am, dear Sir Gilbert, yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_407:1_362" id="FNanchor_407:1_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_407:1_362" class="fnanchor">[407:1]</a></p>
</div>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"10th Sept. 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Gilbert</span>,&mdash;Lord North has refused the office of
Chancellor of the Exchequer; though it was earnestly pressed
upon him, and though he professed an entire satisfaction with
every person in the administration. He dreads the labour of
the office, <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_408" id="Page_v2_408">[408]</a></span>especially as it obliges him to take so great a
part in the business of the House of Commons. It will not
probably be offered to any Scotsman, for fear of popular
reflections concerning the influence of the Thane. The same
objection, as well as others, lie against Dyson, who has been
thought of. I see the ministry in some perplexity; perhaps
this incident may draw on new resignations and negotiations,
and cabals. I think one defect of the present situation of our
government is, that nobody desires much to have any share in
the administration, except adventurers, of whom the public is
naturally distrustful. The pecuniary emoluments are of no
consideration to men of rank and fortune. You have often more
personal regard from being in the opposition. The protection
of the law is at all times sufficient for your security; and
by acquiring authority you are exposed to insults, instead of
gaining the power to revenge them.<a name="FNanchor_408:1_363" id="FNanchor_408:1_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_408:1_363" class="fnanchor">[408:1]</a> Why, then, should a
man of birth, fortune, and parts, sacrifice his fame and peace

the perfection of the most perfect government."<a name="FNanchor_408:2_364" id="FNanchor_408:2_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_408:2_364" class="fnanchor">[408:2]</a></p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;The picture which Donaldson has done for me is a
drawing; and, in every body's opinion, as well as my own, is
the likest that has been done for me, as well as the best
likeness. Since you still <!-- Page 409 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_409" id="Page_v2_409">[409]</a></span>insist that an engraving should be
made from it, we are [thus] more likely to have a good
engraving made than by any other means. I shall, however, be
glad to sit to Ferguson.<a name="FNanchor_409:1_365" id="FNanchor_409:1_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:1_365" class="fnanchor">[409:1]</a> I intend to give up all my
leisure time to the correction of my History, and to contrive
more leisure than I have possessed since I came into public
office. I had run over four volumes; but I shall give them a
second perusal, and employ the same, or greater accuracy in
correcting the other four. I shall read carefully all the
records in the Paper Office, as far back as they go, and shall
leave nothing untried that may bestow the greatest exactness
upon it. For this reason, as well as many others, I would not
have you precipitate this edition, which is probably the last
that I may have occasion to make. I would wish to leave that
work as little imperfect as possible to posterity. I am,"

<p>Gibbon tells us, in his amusing autobiography, that with the assistance
of his friend Deyverdun, he had written in French a portion of a history
of Switzerland, and that the opinions he heard expressed when a fragment
of it was anonymously read before a society in London, prompted him to
abandon the work, and burn the portion he had written. "I delivered," he
says, "my imperfect sketches to the flames." Yet, singularly enough, he
seems to have confounded the intention with the fulfilment, for they
were discovered after his death, but were not thought worthy of being
published by his literary executor, Lord Sheffield.<a name="FNanchor_409:3_367" id="FNanchor_409:3_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_409:3_367" class="fnanchor">[409:3]</a> Gibbon had
endeavoured to find for <!-- Page 410 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_410" id="Page_v2_410">[410]</a></span>his friend Deyverdun some employment in
England, picturesquely observing, that his own "purse was always open,
but it was often empty." They wrote in company some numbers of a
periodical, now very rare, called "<cite class="nonital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mémoires Littéraires de La Grande
Bretagne</cite>," and Gibbon informs us that these specimens of their labours
introduced them to the notice of Hume,<a name="FNanchor_410:1_368" id="FNanchor_410:1_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_410:1_368" class="fnanchor">[410:1]</a> in whose office Deyverdun

<p class="letterdateit">Baiton, 4th October, 1767.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;A six years' residence in Switzerland inspired me with
the design of writing a general history of that brave and free
people, so little known to the rest of Europe, but whom I had
studied with some attention. This design was dropt almost as
soon as conceived, from the almost insurmountable difficulty
of procuring proper materials, as they were mostly in German,
a language I am totally unacquainted with. A Swiss gentleman,
and intimate friend of mine, has removed that difficulty. Mr.
Deyverdun, who passed the summer with me in the country two
years ago, approved very much my design, and offered to assist
me by translating what was most difficult, himself, and by
superintending a German translator, as to the remainder. He is
now returning to London after a much shorter visit than I
desired; and as he has the happiness of supporting some
connexion with you, I flattered myself that you might indulge
a wish, perhaps presumptuous, that I had conceived, and that
you would condescend to glance your eye over the sheets of
this History, which I had already drawn up in a language
indeed foreign to an Englishman, but which the favourable
reception of a former essay engaged me to make use of.</p>

<p>Give me leave, sir, to add, that I must beg you to consider
this liberty as a proof of my respect; and that I shall
consider your severity as a mark of your esteem. If you
<!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_411" id="Page_v2_411">[411]</a></span>advise me to burn what I have already wrote, I shall
immediately execute your sentence, with a full persuasion that
it is just. Let me say, however, I have perhaps vanity enough
to make so unlimited a sacrifice to no man in Europe but to
Mr. Hume. I am, sir, with the greatest esteem, your most
obedient humble servant,</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 24th October, 1767.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;It is but a few days since Mr. Deyverdun put your
manuscript into my hands; and I have perused it with great
pleasure and satisfaction. I have only one objection, derived
from the language in which it is written. Why do you compose
in French, and carry fagots into the wood, as Horace says,
with regard to the Romans who wrote in Greek? I grant, that
you have a like motive to those Romans, and adopt a language
much more generally diffused than your native tongue: but have
you not remarked the fate of those two ancient languages in
following ages? The Latin, though then less celebrated, and
confined to more narrow limits, has, in some measure, outlived
the Greek, and is now more generally understood by men of
letters. Let the French, therefore, triumph in the present
diffusion of their tongue. Our solid and increasing
establishments in America, where we need less dread the
inundation of barbarians, promise a superior stability and
duration to the English language.</p>

<p>"Your use of the French tongue has also led you into a style
more poetical and figurative, and more highly coloured, than
our language seems to admit of in historical productions: for
such is the practice of <!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_412" id="Page_v2_412">[412]</a></span>French writers, particularly the more
recent ones, who illuminate their pictures more than custom
will permit us. On the whole, your History, in my opinion, is
written with spirit and judgment; and I exhort you very
earnestly to continue it. The objections that occurred to me
on reading it were so frivolous, that I shall not trouble you
with them, and should, I believe, have a difficulty to collect
them. I am, with great esteem," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_412:1_370" id="FNanchor_412:1_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_412:1_370" class="fnanchor">[412:1]</a></p>

<p>Some remarks communicated to Dr. Robertson, on his "History of Charles
V." while that work was passing through the press, have deservedly
attracted notice by their unconstrained and natural playfulness.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Robertson</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I got yesterday from Strahan about thirty sheets of your
History to be sent over to Suard, and last night and this
morning have run them over with great avidity. I could not
deny myself the satisfaction (which I hope also will not
displease you) of expressing presently my extreme approbation
of them. To say only that they are very well written, is by
far too faint an expression, and much inferior to the
sentiments I feel. They are composed with nobleness, with
dignity, with elegance, and with judgment, to which there are
few equals. They even excel, and, I think, in a sensible
degree, your "History of Scotland." I propose to myself great
pleasure in being the only man in England, during some months,
who will be in the situation of doing you justice,&mdash;after
which you may certainly expect that my voice will be drowned
in that of the public.</p>

<p>You know that you and I have always been on the footing of
finding in each other's productions <em>something to blame, and
something to commend</em>; and therefore you may perhaps expect
also some seasoning of the former kind; but really neither my
leisure nor inclination allowed me to make such remarks; and I
sincerely believe you have afforded me very small materials
for them. However, such particulars as <!-- Page 413 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_413" id="Page_v2_413">[413]</a></span>occur to my memory, I
shall mention. <em>Maltreat</em> is a Scoticism which occurs once.
What the devil had you to do with that old fashioned dangling
word <em>wherewith</em>? I should as soon take back <em>whereupon</em>,
<em>whereunto</em>, and <em>wherewithal</em>. I think the only tolerable
decent gentleman of the family is <em>wherein</em>; and I should not
choose to be often seen in his company. But I know your
affection for <em>wherewith</em> proceeds from your partiality to
Dean Swift, whom I can often laugh with, whose style I can
even approve, but surely can never admire. It has no harmony,
no eloquence, no ornament; and not much correctness, whatever
the English may imagine. Were not their literature still in a
somewhat barbarous state, that author's place would not be so
high among their classics. But what a fancy is this you have
taken of saying always <em>an hand</em>, <em>an heart</em>, <em>an head</em>? Have
you <em>an ear</em>? Do you not know that this (n) is added before
vowels to prevent the cacophony, and ought never to take place
before (h) when that letter is sounded? It is never pronounced
in these words; why should it be wrote? Thus, I should say, <em>a
history</em>, and <em>an historian</em>; and so would you too, if you had
any sense. But you tell me that Swift does otherwise. To be
sure there is no reply to that; and we must swallow your
<em>hath</em> too upon the same authority. I will see you d&mdash;&mdash;d
sooner. But I will endeavour to keep my temper.</p>

<p>I do not like this sentence in page 149: <i>This step was taken
in consequence of the treaty Wolsey had concluded with the
Emperor at Brussels, and which had hitherto been kept secret.</i>
<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Si sic omnia dixisses</span>, I should never have been plagued with
hearing your praises so often sounded, and that fools
preferred your style to mine. Certainly it had been better to
have said, <em>which</em> Wolsey, &amp;c. That relative ought very seldom
to be omitted; and is here particularly requisite to preserve
a symmetry between the two members of the sentence. You omit
the relative too often, which is a colloquial barbarism, as Mr
Johnson calls it.</p>

<p>Your periods are sometimes, though not often, too long. Suard
will be embarrassed with them, as the modish French style runs
into the other extreme.<a name="FNanchor_413:1_371" id="FNanchor_413:1_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_413:1_371" class="fnanchor">[413:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 414 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_414" id="Page_v2_414">[414]</a></span>Turgot, at the instigation of some Italian friends, had applied to Hume
to recommend a scholar, who would undertake to teach the English
language and literature at Parma. He selected Robert Liston; but he had
overlooked an objection which the enlightened promoters of the scheme in
Italy appear to have considered too obvious to require preliminary
explanation, that Liston was a Protestant! In returning thanks to Hume
for the unavailing recommendation, Liston discovers the bent of his
genius, by desiring that, if an opportunity should occur, Hume would
recommend him as secretary of legation to any of the secondary
embassies. The fate of the Parma scheme was thus communicated to Elliot.</p>

poor Liston, who will be disappointed in the scheme for Parma:
they will have nothing but a Papist. Such fools! Let the Pope
excommunicate them on the one hand: I will do so on the other.</p>

<p>"I have seen a book newly printed at Edinburgh, called
'Philosophical Essays:' it has no manner of sense in it, but
is wrote with tolerable neatness of style: whence I conjecture
it to be our friend, Sir David's.<a name="FNanchor_414:1_372" id="FNanchor_414:1_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_414:1_372" class="fnanchor">[414:1]</a> I am obliged to him

five years in a dungeon, and then to be hanged, and my carcass

the authority of Plato, whom I own to be truly divine. Pray,
have you seen the book? Is it Sir David's? I think it has not
so many attempts at humour, as that pious gentleman would
employ.</p>

<p>"We are all very quiet here; as quiet as you are at Minto,
though perhaps not so busy. No more noise of Wilkes and
Liberty. Lord Mansfield said to me, that it was impossible for
him to condemn him to the pillory, because the
attorney-general did not demand it. Yesterday he represented
to the Spanish ambassador, that moderate sentence, as a
refinement in politics, which reduced the scoundrel the sooner
to obscurity. It would be a strange cause, which he could not
find plausible reasons to justify.</p>

family who may be at Minto. I ever am, dear Sir Gilbert, yours

<p>"I am sorry, my dear sir, for poor Liston's disappointment. I
am told he thought himself secure. I have seen the book you
mention; but you do injustice to our friend Sir David. He is
not the author; but a very moral and worthy man, who, I
believe, once had the honour to attend you in some of your
writings before,&mdash;his name James Balfour&mdash;at least I am told
so. The young feudal author, Gilbert Stewart, is just now in
my neighbourhood; and, his father tells me, impatient, to a
great degree, for your letter. It seems he is much your
admirer. However, I hope my criticisms, on some parts of his
work, may keep him from carrying his admiration, on some
points, too far. Not that I mean to close with my friend, Mr.
Balfour, in his candid proposition for treating you after the
manner of the divine Plato. I rest <!-- Page 416 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_416" id="Page_v2_416">[416]</a></span>entirely on you for
politics, changes of ministry, foreign politics, and domestic
occurrences. I have now no correspondents; and I did not think
it prudent to engage with any ministerial men; as I might be
led, in such a correspondence, to commit mistakes, which may
be inconvenient next winter. Farming, I find, is very
expensive&mdash;days' wages now at a shilling; but our fields are
green, and the hedges thrive. I hope to see your brother this
autumn. He is very orthodox, I am told, so far as husbandry
goes. I hope to hear your love affair, and your King William,
are in a good way. My wife not yet arrived. Yours," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_416:1_374" id="FNanchor_416:1_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_416:1_374" class="fnanchor">[416:1]</a></p>

<p>Gilbert Stuart, then unknown to fame, whether good or bad, and still
possessed of any small portion of modesty he had ever been endowed with,
was about to publish his little work on the British constitution, the
temporary celebrity of which had so prejudicial an effect on his
subsequent career. We shall afterwards have an opportunity of noticing
him on an occasion when he seems to have thought that the relation which
Hume and he bore to each other, in 1768, of humble admirer and
distinguished patron, was reversed in his favour.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert Elliot</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"22d July, 1768.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Gilbert</span>,&mdash;I send you my letter enclosed to Mr.
Stewart; which I hope is calculated to encourage a young man
of merit. Without overstraining the compliment, it were
better, however, for him, and for every body, to pursue, in
preference to the idle trade of writing, some other lawful
occupation, such as cheating like an attorney; quacking like a
physician; canting and hypocrising like a parson, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
It is for very little purpose to go out of the <!-- Page 417 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_417" id="Page_v2_417">[417]</a></span>common track.
Does he expect to make men wiser? a very pretty expectation
truly!</p>

<p>"I fancy the ministry will remain; though surely their late
remissness, or ignorance, or pusillanimity, ought to make them
ashamed to show their faces, were it even at Newmarket. There
are fine doings in America. O! how I long to see America and
the East Indies revolted, totally and finally,&mdash;the revenue
reduced to half,&mdash;public credit fully discredited by
bankruptcy,&mdash;the third of London in ruins, and the rascally
mob subdued! I think I am not too old to despair of being
witness to all these blessings. I approve of your farming
scheme, notwithstanding the expense; though your situation, as
well for markets as means of improvement, is not advantageous.
My brother's advice may be of use to you; but you are always
to remember that he is of the sect of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">médecin tant pis</i>;
had he possessed enterprise, proportioned to his industry and
skill, he might have gone far in that way.<a name="FNanchor_417:1_375" id="FNanchor_417:1_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_417:1_375" class="fnanchor">[417:1]</a></p>

<p>"I continue my parasitical practices; that is, of dining at
all the great tables that remain in London. We are likely to
be plagued with this King of Denmark; though not so much as
formerly with Canute the Great. I have some thoughts of paying
a visit to France this autumn; that is, if I can collect
enough of resolution to leave the present place of abode.</p>

<p>"When I wrote last, I did not know that Lady &mdash;&mdash; had eloped;
that practice continues very fashionable here; and it is to be
hoped will spread itself more and more every day!</p>

write English on the other side of the Tweed. I did not think
of Balfour. It is very true he would fain, I see, be candid,
and civil, as in his other book; if his zeal for the house of
the Lord would permit him.</p>

<p>"Lord Bute certainly sets out this day se'ennight, and, it is
said, is in a very bad state of health.</p>

<p>"Lord Chatham is a greater paradox than ever:&mdash;is seen at home
by no human creature;&mdash;absolutely by none! rides twenty miles
every day,&mdash;is seen on the road, and appears in perfect good
health; but will now speak to no creature he meets. I am much

<p>Towards the end of the year 1768, poor Smollett, with his spirit crushed
by the united calamities of a broken constitution and ruined fortunes,
sought to retrieve his health, by travelling in Italy. Before commencing
his journey, he wrote the following letter; in which the too apparent
tone of despondency is yet insufficient to damp the kindly warmth of his
feelings:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Perhaps I overrate my own consequence when I
presume to recommend to your acquaintance and good offices,
the bearer, Captain Robert Stobo; a man whose very
extraordinary services and sufferings in America, have
merited, and obtained the most ample and honourable
testimonials, which he will gladly submit to your perusal. I
can safely say from my own knowledge, that he is not less
modest and sensible in the conversation and occurrences of
civil life, <!-- Page 419 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_419" id="Page_v2_419">[419]</a></span>than enterprising and indefatigable in his
military capacity. All these good qualities, united to an
extensive knowledge of our American concerns, cannot fail to
engage the friendship and regard of Mr. David Hume, from what
quarter so ever they may come recommended.</p>

<p>With respect to myself, I am sorry I cannot have the pleasure
of taking leave of you in person, before I go into perpetual
exile. I sincerely wish you all health and happiness. In
whatever part of the earth it may be my fate to reside, I
shall always remember with pleasure, and recapitulate with
pride, the friendly intercourse I have maintained with one of
the best men, and undoubtedly the best writer of the age; if

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I did not see your friend, Captain Stobo, till
the day before I left Cirencester, and only for a little time;
but he seemed to be a man of good sense, and has surely had
the most extraordinary adventures in the world. He has
promised to call on me when he comes to London, and I shall
always see him with pleasure.</p>

<p>"But what is this you tell me of your perpetual exile, and of
your never returning to this country? I hope that as this idea
arose from the bad state of your health, it will vanish on
your recovery; which, from your past experience, you may
expect from those happier climates to which you are retiring;
after <!-- Page 420 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_420" id="Page_v2_420">[420]</a></span>which the desire of revisiting your native country will
probably return upon you, unless the superior cheapness of
foreign countries prove an obstacle, and detain you there. I
could wish that means had been fallen on to remove this
objection; and that at least it might be equal to you to live
any where, except where the consideration of your health gave
the preference to one climate above another. But the
indifference of ministers towards literature, which has been
long, and indeed always, the case in England, gives little
prospect of any alteration in this particular.</p>

<p>"I am sensible of your great partiality, in the good opinion
you express towards me; but it gives me no less pleasure than
if it were founded on the greatest truth, for I accept it as a
pledge of your good will and friendship. I wish an opportunity
of showing my sense of it may present itself during your
absence. I assure you I should embrace it with great alacrity,
and you need have no scruple, on every occasion, of having
recourse to me. I am, my dear sir, with great esteem and
sincerity, your most obedient, and most humble servant,"

remainder will probably be as surprising to the reader as it is new. It
is very evident that Hume exercised towards the great Chatham, Dr.
Johnson's virtue of honest hatred. There was indeed little love lost
between these great contemporaries; for Chatham fiercely attacked the
constitutional doctrines of the History of England, and Hume looked upon
the national idol as an unprincipled <!-- Page 421 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_421" id="Page_v2_421">[421]</a></span>demagogue. The words with which
the observations on the Douglas cause conclude, are evidence of the
contempt which, amidst all his Tory prepossessions, Hume preserved for
merely hereditary rank, and indeed for all nominal and outward marks of
distinction, which were not allied to intellectual superiority.</p>

last production; nor more deservedly. I agree with you, it is
beyond his first performance, as was indeed natural to be
expected. I hope, for a certain reason, which I keep to
myself, that he does not intend, in his third work, to go
beyond his second, though I am damnably afraid he will, for
the subject is much more interesting. Neither the character of
Charles V., nor the incidents of his life, are very
interesting; and, were it not for the first volume, the
success of this work, though perfectly well writ, would not
have been so shining.</p>

<p>"This madness about Wilkes excited first indignation, then
apprehension; but has gone to such a height that all other
sentiments with me are buried in ridicule. This exceeds the
absurdity of Titus Gates and the Popish plot: and is so much
more disgraceful to the nation, as the former folly, being
derived from religion, flowed from a source which has from
uniform prescription acquired a right to impose nonsense on
all nations and all ages. But the present extravagance is
peculiar to ourselves, and quite risible. However, I am afraid
my mirth will soon be spoilt, and affairs become quite
serious; for I am well assured that Lord Chatham will, after
the holidays, creep out from his retreat and appear on the
scene.</p>

time. It was abominable with regard to poor Andrew Stuart, who
had conducted that cause with singular ability and integrity;
and was at last exposed to reproach, which unfortunately never
can be wiped off. For the cause, though not in the least
intricate, is so complicated, that it never will be reviewed
by the public, who are besides perfectly pleased with the
sentence; being swayed by compassion and a few popular topics.
To one who understands the cause as I do, nothing could appear
more scandalous than the pleadings of the two law lords. Such
gross misrepresentation, such impudent assertions, such
groundless imputations, never came from that place. But all
was good enough for their audience; who, bating their quality,
are most of them little better than their brethren the
Wilkites in the streets.</p>

very accomplished young man. The death of your brother-in-law
is a great loss to you, and even to us all. I comprehend
myself; for I intend to visit you soon, and for good and all.
Indeed, I know not what detains me here, except that it is so
much a matter of indifference where I live; and I am amused
with looking on the scene, which really begins to be
interesting. I had taken one of Allan Ramsay's houses;<a name="FNanchor_424:1_387" id="FNanchor_424:1_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_424:1_387" class="fnanchor">[424:1]</a>
but gave it up again, on the representation of some of my
friends in Edinburgh, who said that a house, on the north side
of a high hill, in the 56th degree of latitude, could not be
healthful. But I now repent it, though I have my old house to
retreat to till I get a better. I am glad you like my nephew.

giddy.<a name="FNanchor_424:2_388" id="FNanchor_424:2_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_424:2_388" class="fnanchor">[424:2]</a>"</p>

<p>Andrew Stuart, who is noticed in the preceding letter, and has
frequently been referred to in Hume's correspondence, was a man of great
talent. His letters to Lord Mansfield, on the Douglas cause, remarkable
for their solemn asperity, belong to a species of literature, of which
the English language scarcely boasts of any other instance,&mdash;a
systematic and serious arraignment of the conduct of a Judge in the
highest court in the realm, by the law agent of a litigant! Stuart
conducted the investigations in France, on which the evidence that the
children said to be born to Lady Jane Douglas were spurious, was
founded; and from the strange circumstances brought forward in the
evidence, we can imagine that, if Stuart had left a diary of his
adventures and inquiries, few works of fiction could be more
interesting. His <!-- Page 425 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_425" id="Page_v2_425">[425]</a></span>arraignment of the judge was accompanied by an act
almost equally anomalous: his challenging the counsel on the other
side&mdash;who was Mr. Wedderburn, afterwards Lord Loughborough&mdash;on account
of the manner in which his conduct had been spoken of in the appeal
case. The challenge was accepted; but neither party was wounded. From
occasional allusions, in Hume's correspondence, he and Stuart appear to
have been early friends; and many of the letters, which he preserved,
within a few years of his death, are from Stuart, who, occasionally,
appears to write in acknowledgment of pecuniary advances. Among Hume's
papers, there is a letter, of which the address has not been preserved,
but in which there is a note, in Baron Hume's handwriting, that it was,
"respecting his friend Stuart&mdash;Andrew, I suppose." The letter has a
sufficient interest in itself. It is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Nothing can be more just than the sentiment you
have expressed in your letter. I am to be envied for having
had it in my power to contribute to the happiness of the best
man, and the most intimate friend I have ever had in the
world. There is nothing else in the possession of a fortune
that deserves the least envy or the least consideration. Every
man is independent who thinks himself so. But every man has
not been blessed with such a friend, or with the power of
showing, in some small degree, the value he puts upon worth,
delicacy, attachment, and ability like his. It adds to my
happiness not a little, that your sentiments coincide so
entirely with mine. You have known Stuart enough to value him
as much as I do; and he has too much discernment not to put
the same high value upon you, which you have commanded from
every one of your friends."</p>

<p><!-- Page 426 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_426" id="Page_v2_426">[426]</a></span>Hume received a letter from the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Morellet</span>, dated 15th May
1769,<a name="FNanchor_426:1_389" id="FNanchor_426:1_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_426:1_389" class="fnanchor">[426:1]</a> requesting him to accept of a copy of his forthcoming
"<cite class="notital" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Prospectus d'un Nouveau Dictionnaire de Commerce</cite>;" and to distribute
some others among a list of names, including those of Adam Smith and
Benjamin Franklin. The comprehensive work of which the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span> thus
developed what he considered the proper principles, was never written by
him. He was too much occupied with fugitive literature, and the
absorbing politics of the time, to be able seriously to pursue a project
involving so much steady industry. Hume answered as follows:&mdash;</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to the</i> <span class="smcap" lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Morellet</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">London, 10th July, 1769.</p>

<p>That part of your prospectus, in which you endeavour to prove
that there enters nothing of human convention in the
establishment of money, is certainly very curious, and very
elaborately composed; and yet I cannot forbear thinking that
the common opinion has some foundation. It is true, money must
always be made of some materials, which have intrinsic value,
otherwise it would be multiplied without end, and would sink
to nothing. But, when I take a shilling, I consider it not as
a useful metal, but as something which another will take from
me; and the person who shall convert it into metal is,
probably, several millions of removes distant. You know that
all states have made it criminal to melt their coin; and,
though this is a law which cannot well be executed, it is not
to be supposed that, if it could, it would entirely destroy
the value of the money, according to your hypothesis. You have
a base coin, called billon, in France, composed of silver and
copper, which has a ready currency, though the separation of
the two metals, and the reduction of them to their primitive
state, would, I am told, be both expensive and troublesome.
Our shillings and sixpences, which are almost our only silver
coin, are so much worn by use, that they are twenty, thirty,
or forty per cent. below <!-- Page 427 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_427" id="Page_v2_427">[427]</a></span>their original value; yet they pass
currently; which can arise only from a tacit convention. Our
colonies in America, for want of specie, used to coin a paper
currency; which were not bank notes, because there was no
place appointed to give money in exchange: yet this paper
currency passed in all payments, by convention; and might have
gone on, had it not been abused by the several assemblies, who
issued paper without end, and thereby discredited the
currency.</p>

<p>You mention several kinds of money, sheep, oxen, fish,
employed as measures of exchange, or as money, in different
parts of the world. You have overlooked that, in our colony of
Pennsylvania, the land itself, which is the chief commodity,
is coined, and passes in circulation. The manner of conducting
this affair is as follows:&mdash;A planter, immediately after he
purchases any land, can go to a public office and receive
notes to the amount of half the value of his land; which notes
he employs in all payments, and they circulate through the
whole colony, by convention. To prevent the public from being
overwhelmed by this fictitious money, there are two means
employed&mdash;first, the notes issued to any one planter, must not
exceed a certain sum, whatever may be the value of his land:
secondly, every planter is obliged to pay back into the public
office every year one-tenth part of his notes; the whole, of
course, is annihilated in ten years; after which, it is again
allowed him to take out new notes to half the value of his
land. An account of this curious operation would enrich your
dictionary; and you may have a more particular detail of it,
if you please, from Dr. Franklin, who will be in Paris about
this time, and will be glad to see you. I conveyed to him your
prospectus, and he expressed to me a great esteem of it.</p>

<p>I see that, in your prospectus, you take care not to disoblige
your economists, by any declaration of your sentiments; in
which I commend your prudence. But I hope that in your work
you will thunder them, and crush them, and pound them, and
reduce them to dust and ashes! They are, indeed, the set of
men the most chimerical and most arrogant that now exist,
since the annihilation of the Sorbonne. I ask your pardon for
saying so, as I know you belong to that venerable body. I
wonder what could engage our friend, M. <!-- Page 428 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_428" id="Page_v2_428">[428]</a></span>Turgot, to herd among
them; I mean, among the economists; though I believe he was
also a Sorbonnist.</p>

<p>I sent your prospectus to Dr. Tucker, but have not heard from
him since. I shall myself deliver copies to Dr. Robertson and
Mr. Smith, as I go to Scotland this autumn.</p>

<p>And now, my dear <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span>, what remains to me but to wish you
success in your judicious labours? to embrace you, and through
you, to embrace all our common friends, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">D'Alembert, Helvétius,
Buffon, Baron d'Holbach, Suard, Mlle. L'Espinasse</span>? Poor <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé
Le Bon</span> is dead, I hear. The <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Galliani</span> goes to Naples: he
does well to leave Paris before I come thither; for I should
certainly put him to death for all the ill he has spoken of
England. But it has happened, as was foretold by his friend,
Caraccioli; who said that the Abbé would remain two months in
this country, would speak all himself, would not allow an
Englishman to utter a syllable; and after returning would give
the character of the nation during the rest of his life, as if
he were perfectly well acquainted with them.</p>

<p>Pray make my compliments to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Maletête</span>. Tell him, that Prince
Masserane says, that he has saved much effusion of blood to
this country. It is certain that <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">M. Maletête</span> had a great
curiosity to see a riot here, and yet was resolved to keep his
person in safety. For this purpose, he hired a window; and
proposed to be present at one of the mad elections of Wilkes,
and to divert himself with the fray. Somebody got a hint of
it, and put it into the newspapers; asking the freeholders if
they were so degenerate as to make themselves a laughing
stock, even to the French, their enemies, whom they despised.
Prince Masserane alleges that this incident made that election
so remarkably peaceable!</p>

<p>Are you acquainted with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Crébillon</span>? I am ashamed to mention his
name. He sent me over his last work, with a very obliging
letter: but as I must write to him in French, I have never
answered him. If all the English were as impertinent as I am,
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé Galliani</span> would have reason to abuse us.&mdash;I am, dear
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Abbé</span>, after asking your blessing, yours sincerely.<a name="FNanchor_428:1_390" id="FNanchor_428:1_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_428:1_390" class="fnanchor">[428:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 429 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_429" id="Page_v2_429">[429]</a></span>"I returned to Edinburgh in 1769," says Hume in his "own Life," "very
opulent, (for I possessed a revenue of £1000 a-year) healthy, and though
somewhat stricken in years, with the prospect of enjoying long my ease,
and of seeing the increase of my reputation." He had thus finally
triumphed over the temptations which assailed him abroad, and resolved
to spend the remainder of his days among the friends of his youth. He
had received very strong solicitations from Madame de Boufflers and
others, to take up his abode at Paris. In one letter she informs him
that there is a house prepared for him in the Temple, and another with a
large garden near the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bois de Boulogne</span>.<a name="FNanchor_429:1_391" id="FNanchor_429:1_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_429:1_391" class="fnanchor">[429:1]</a> To these pressing offers
he seems not to have trusted himself with rendering a direct answer,
leaving his projects undefined, until, by returning to Edinburgh, he
rendered the acceptance of such invitations impracticable. Fairly
re-established in his old house in James's Court, and enjoying its
magnificent prospect, we find him thus writing to Smith:&mdash;</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"James's Court, 20th August, 1769.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I am glad to have come within sight of you, and
to have a view of Kirkaldy from my windows: but as I wish also
to be within speaking terms of you, I wish we could concert
measures for that purpose. I am mortally sick at sea, and
regard with horror, and a kind of hydrophobia, the great
gulf<a name="FNanchor_429:2_392" id="FNanchor_429:2_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_429:2_392" class="fnanchor">[429:2]</a> that lies between us. I am also tired of
travelling; as much as you ought naturally to be of staying at
home. I therefore propose to you to come hither, and pass some
days with me in this solitude. <!-- Page 430 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_430" id="Page_v2_430">[430]</a></span>I want to know what you have
been doing; and propose to exact a rigorous account of the
method in which you have employed yourself during your
retreat. I am positive you are in the wrong in many of your
speculations, especially where you have the misfortune to
differ from me. All these are reasons for our meeting, and I
wish you would make me some reasonable proposal for that
purpose. There is no habitation on the island of Inchkeith,
otherwise I should challenge you to meet me on that spot, and
neither of us ever to leave the place, till we were fully
agreed on all points of controversy. I expect General Conway
here to morrow, whom I shall attend to Roseneath, and I shall
remain there a few days. On my return, I expect to find a
letter from you, containing a bold acceptance of this
defiance. I am, dear Smith, yours sincerely."<a name="FNanchor_430:1_393" id="FNanchor_430:1_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_430:1_393" class="fnanchor">[430:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The letters addressed to Hume at this time, show that he had made
inquiries with the view of continuing the education of his nephews at
one of the English universities. The following letter explains the
reason why this plan was not adopted.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir Gilbert Elliot</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 16th October, 1769.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Gilbert</span>,&mdash;I am very much obliged to you for the
pains you have taken to give me an account of your sons'
expenses and management at Oxford. I found my brother
undetermined, or rather averse, to the project. He thinks his
son rather inclines to be dissipated and idle; and believes
that a year or two at Oxford would confirm him thoroughly in
that habit, <!-- Page 431 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_431" id="Page_v2_431">[431]</a></span>without any other advantage than the acquiring of
a little better pronunciation; for this reason he seems rather
inclined to try him a year in the Law College here, before he
makes him so much his own master.</p>

<p>"I have been settled here two months, and am here body and
soul, without casting the least thought of regret to London,
or even to Paris. I think it improbable that I shall ever in
my life cross the Tweed, except perhaps a jaunt to the north
of England, for health or amusement. I live still, and must
for a twelvemonth, in my old house in James's Court, which is
very cheerful, and even elegant, but too small to display my
great talent for cookery, the science to which I intend to
addict the remaining years of my life! I have just now lying
on the table before me, a receipt for making <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe à la
reine</i>, copied with my own hand: for beef and cabbage, (a
charming dish,) and old mutton, and old claret, nobody excels
me. I make also sheep-head broth, in a manner that Mr. Keith
speaks of it for eight days after; and the Duc de Nivernois
would bind himself apprentice to my lass to learn it. I have
already sent a challenge to David Moncreif: you will see that
in a twelvemonth he will take to the writing of history, the
field I have deserted; for as to the giving of dinners, he can
now have no further pretensions. I should have made a very bad
use of my abode in Paris, if I could not get the better of a
mere provincial like him. All my friends encourage me in this
ambition; as thinking it will redound very much to my honour.</p>

<p>"I am delighted to see the daily and hourly progress of
madness, and folly, and wickedness in England. The
consummation of these qualities are the true ingredients for
making a fine narrative in history, especially if followed by
some signal and ruinous <!-- Page 432 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_432" id="Page_v2_432">[432]</a></span>convulsion,&mdash;as I hope will soon be
the case with that pernicious people! He must be a very bad
cook indeed, who cannot make a palatable dish from the whole.
You see in my reflexions and allusions, I shall mix my old and
new professions together. I am, dear Sir Gilbert, your most
obedient humble servant," &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_432:1_394" id="FNanchor_432:1_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_432:1_394" class="fnanchor">[432:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 5th February, 1770.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Gilbert</span>,&mdash;I do not know whether you be good for any
thing, or at all worth the applying to; I rather suspect not:
but in case you are, I make you the following application in
favour of Christopher Tate, probationer, who was tutor to my
nephews. You know I resigned my pretensions on the
presentation of Humbie to your nephew's tutor; but under
promise, that you would assist me in a like case. This kirk is
a king's presentation; it is within your county, and I very
earnestly desire success in this application, and trust much
to your friendship in it.</p>

<p>"The last unexpected incident strikes us mute with
astonishment; either the Duke of Grafton is much to blame for
leaving us so abruptly in so very critical a time, or a
greater than he, if he got any just cause for it. I carry my
view to very dismal consequences, especially as I suspect the
last to be the case. I fancy we shall have curious scenes,
worthy the pen of the greatest historian. I am tired and
disgusted with conjecture. My compliments to Lady Elliot.

<p>To Smith, whose "Wealth of Nations" was now <!-- Page 433 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_433" id="Page_v2_433">[433]</a></span>supposed to be nearly ready
for the press, we find the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"6th February, 1770.</p>

<p>"What is the meaning of this, dear Smith, which we hear, that
you are not to be here above a day or two, on your passage to
London? How can you so much as entertain a thought of
publishing a book full of reason, sense, and learning, to
those wicked abandoned madmen?</p>

<p>"I suppose you have not yet got over your astonishment at this
most astonishing resignation. For my part, I knew not at first
whether to throw the blame on the Duke or the King; but I now
find it is entirely and completely the Duke's own; and I think
him dishonoured for ever."</p>
</div>

<p>This refers to the Duke of Grafton's resignation, of which he proceeds
to quote an account from "a very good hand," prophesying tranquillity
and the restoration of confidence.</p>

<p>"So far my friend&mdash;whose prophecy I hope will be fulfilled; though, for
my part, I am rather inclined to give myself up to despair. Nothing but
a rebellion and bloodshed will open the eyes of that deluded people;
though, were they alone concerned, I think it is no matter what becomes
of them."<a name="FNanchor_433:1_396" id="FNanchor_433:1_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_433:1_396" class="fnanchor">[433:1]</a></p>

<p>In the following letter, we have a farther, and a very strong instance
of Hume's dislike of the English as a people. We find him again busy in
sifting his History of all remains of popular principles; and there is a
tone throughout the letter, as if it were satisfactory to him to be able
to overturn the objects of popular idolatry, which a people he so
heartily disliked had endeavoured to set up, in the alleged antiquity of
their constitution.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 21st February, 1770.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Sir Gilbert</span>,&mdash;I am glad of your victories; though I look
upon them all as temporary and imperfect, like the fallacious
recoveries of a hectic person, who is hastening to his
dissolution. Our government has become a chimera, and is too
perfect, in point of liberty, for so rude a beast as an
Englishman; who is a man, a bad animal too, corrupted by above
a century of licentiousness. The misfortune is, that this
liberty can scarcely be retrenched without danger of being
entirely lost; at least the fatal effects of licentiousness
must first be made palpable, by some extreme mischief
resulting from it. I may wish that the catastrophe should
rather fall on our posterity; but it hastens on with such
large strides, as leave little room for this hope.</p>

<p>"I am running over again the last edition of my History, in
order to correct it still further. I either soften or expunge
many villanous, seditious Whig strokes, which had crept into
it. I wish that my indignation at the present madness,
encouraged by lies, calumnies, imposture, and every infamous
act usual among popular leaders, may not throw me into the
opposite extreme. I am, however, sensible that the first
editions were too full of those foolish English prejudices,
which all nations and all ages disavow.</p>

<p>"The present firm conduct of the king, and his manly
resentment, afford some glimpse of hope. We, at a distance,
are not acquainted with these matters; and few even at London;
but there still appears something mysterious in the Duke of
Grafton's resignation. I hope it proceeded only from his
discontents with Bedford House.</p>

<p>"I am sorry to inform you, that all we statesmen in this town
condemn loudly the conduct of you statesmen in London,
especially in allowing those insolent rascals, the mayor and
sheriffs, to escape with impunity. We were much disappointed
not to find them impeached, and a bill of pains and penalties
passed upon them. The tumults which might have ensued in
London, we thought rather an advantage; as it would give
government an opportunity of chastising that abominable
rabble. But you have thought otherwise; and it is pretended
that these lenient maxims are succeeding; that faction abates,
the tide turns, and the heroes of opposition are in despair. I
am heartily glad of it: but this is a new experiment to
reconcile such extreme license with government; and if, in a
case where popular complaints had not the smallest shadow of
pretence, the king and parliament have prevailed, after a long
struggle, and with much difficulty, what must it be, where
there is some plausible appearance, and perhaps some real
ground of complaint, such as it is natural to expect in all
governments? However, I repeat it, I am glad of the present
appearance of tranquillity; and, indeed, distant dangers are
not to be too anxiously provided against. I am," &amp;c.</p>

<p>Hume seems to have now commenced the building <!-- Page 436 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_436" id="Page_v2_436">[436]</a></span>of the house, in the New
Town of Edinburgh, in which he died. It was the commencement of the

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 2d October, 1770.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;I am sorry that I should correspond so ill to
your very obliging letter, by telling you, that I cannot
propose to see you till you come to town next winter. I am
engaged in the building a house, which is the second great
operation of human life: for the taking a wife is the first,
which I hope will come in time; and by being present, I have
already prevented two capital mistakes, which the mason was
falling into; and I shall be apprehensive of his falling into
more, were I to be at a distance. I must therefore renounce
the hopes of seeing you at your own house this autumn, which,
I assure [you,] I do with much regret. My compliments to Mrs.
Mure and the young ladies. Please tell Miss Kitty, that my
coat is much admired, even before I tell that it is her
livery. For her sake I shall be careful that it never meet
with any such accident, as the last. I am, dear Baron, yours
very sincerely.<a name="FNanchor_436:2_399" id="FNanchor_436:2_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_436:2_399" class="fnanchor">[436:2]</a></p>

27th May, 1767, cited above, there is the following paragraph:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, how has the General Assembly passed? I have had a long letter
from Mass David Dickson, complaining of your injustice. Has John Home
any thoughts of coming up? Tell Robertson that the compliment, at the
end of General Conway's letter to him, was of my composing, without any
orders from him. He smiled when he read it, but said it was very proper,
and signed it. These are not bad puffs from ministers of state, as the
silly world goes." I inferred from this that the letter in question was
the King's letter to the General Assembly of 1767; but I find no
allusion to Robertson in that document, and am not aware of any letter,
generally known at the period, which answers the above description. It
is clear that Hume refers to some official communication from the
secretary of state. The letter from Dickson is a long complaint about
the conduct of some judicatories as to a forgotten church dispute. It
begins with the statement;&mdash;"I am informed that His Majesty's letter to
the General Assembly, of this year, is issued from the secretary's
office, under your direction." As it is pretty generally believed that
the policy of the Home-office, in its communications with the Church of
Scotland, was directed by Hume, during the period when he was under
secretary, the following extract from the King's letter to the General
Assembly, in 1767, is given, that the reader may judge for himself
whether the style and matter are characteristic of Hume's pen:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Convinced, as we are, of your prudence and firm resolution to concur in
whatever may promote the happiness of our subjects, it is unnecessary
for us to recommend to you to avoid contentious and unedifying debates;
as well as to avoid every thing that may tend to disturb that harmony
and tranquillity which is so essential in councils solely calculated for
the suppression of every species of licentiousness, irreligion, and
vice. And, as we have the firmest reliance on your zeal in the support
of the Christian faith, as well as in the wisdom and prudence of your
councils, we are thoroughly assured that they will be directed to such
purposes as may best tend to enforce a conscientious observance of all
those duties which the true religion, and laws of this kingdom require,
and on which the felicity of every individual so essentially
depends."<a name="FNanchor_383:A_337" id="FNanchor_383:A_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_383:A_337" class="fnanchor">[383:A]</a></p>

remarkably characteristic of the timid and excitable character of the
blind genius. After an exordium on the tone which he hopes their
intercourse will maintain, full of nervous susceptibility; the fear of
being too profuse in correspondence alternating with the dread that he
may be thought cold, negligent, or ungrateful; he gives an account of
the education of his pupil, Joseph, and then turns towards his own dark
prospects.</p>

<p>"It was not indeed without some fear that I undertook the office. The
vivacity of his disposition, and even the quickness of his genius,
inspired me with terror that I should not be able to manage the one, or
make any lasting impression upon the other. But how agreeable was my
disappointment to find his temper, though lively, extremely amiable and
flexible, and his apprehension, though quick, yet distinct and
retentive. He applies with a diligence not often found in people of his
age and character. As during this winter we had a pretty numerous
family, most of whom were gentlemen of parts and spirit, I have seen
numberless instances in which his passions, though warm and sensible,
were governed with a discretion worthy of mature age and experience, yet
in such a manner as to preserve his dignity, and betray no degree of
complaisance unworthy of his spirit, or inconsistent with his ingenuity.
You cannot imagine but such an object must pre-engage every susceptible
heart. He is really admired by all the young gentlemen of our family who
know him. I love him, and Mrs. Blacklock doats on him; yet there are
not, perhaps, two in the human species who have it in their power to vex
me in the same degree, if at any time he should be more remiss and
careless than usual. He is now reading French with Mons<sup>r</sup> Cauvin, and
the Satires of Horace, and Homer's Iliad, with me.</p>

<p>"Mr. Alexander's account of my situation, in general, was right. I have
indeed got clear of a parish where I could have never been happy, even
though their malice had been less implacable than I found it. But when I
left that vindictive place, my poetical vanity was not quite
extinguished; and it is natural for those who have felt the oppressive
hand of unprovoked injury, to expect a kinder and more human reception,
where civility, politeness, and gentler manners prevail. These
sentiments, too sanguinely indulged, might perhaps have raised my hopes
too high, and taught me to anticipate a greater degree of notice from
the people of taste and learning in this place, than I have either
obtained or deserved. Be that as it will, I am at present almost an
absolute recluse; and when I meet with any of the virtuosi in public
places, (where, indeed, I do not commonly appear,) their behaviour seems
more cool and reserved than I could have thought. Not that all my
self-importance can flatter me with any degree of merit in this way; but
surely it was not unnatural to hope the enterprises which I attempted in
the circumstances in which I was involved, might have attracted some
degree of attention, and impressed some faint prepossessions in my
favour, when not opposed by any vice or immorality in my character. For
these reasons, as well as the private and disinterested attachment of my
heart, you will naturally imagine the pleasure I feel from the prospect
of your arrival in Edinburgh, and from my promised intercourse with one,
who, though he might do honour to the republic of letters in any period,
yet descends to honour me with the name of a <strong>Friend</strong>."</p>

<p>In the other letter, dated 2d May, 1767, he states that he has been
overworking himself; and says, "My old nervous complaints have been like
to return, and unhinge all our schemes; but, thank God, they are a
little better again." He then details, with some minuteness, the reasons
for feeling that his pecuniary prospects are precarious; and ascribes
his exertions to his wish "to do something, if possible, for these
approaching contingencies," which, he says, "the natural gloom" of his
mind has made "not very distant." He continues:&mdash;</p>

<p>"You was so kind as hint your friendly intention towards a church
settlement. That, I begin to think, I am unfit to encounter with again;
for the ten thousand hardships and disagreeable things which I met with
in my short but dear-bought experience of that kind of life, brought me
a great way on in my journey down hill; so that if any one of them
should again occur in another trial, I would certainly soon reach the
foot of the precipice. This event is matter of no great thought to
myself, but as it may concern one not undeservedly dear to me."</p>

<p>These letters are written with great precision, in a small, neat,
regular hand; and, though duly signed, "Thos. Blacklock," it is clear
that they cannot be the penmanship of their sightless author.</p>

<p>Appended to the second, and in a bolder and more masculine looking hand,
is the following:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mrs. Blacklock begs leave to offer her compliments to Mr. Hume,
herself; and to supplicate some easy thing, if it can be procured,
(without giving Mr. Hume much trouble,) for her friend, whom she has
been a good deal apprehensive for this spring, by reason of his close
study. Our college has acquired a new professor for natural history. Do
you think one for poetry could be added, with a moderate salary to
it?"&mdash;MSS. R.S.E.</p>

thus made by their father in a letter to his brother of 21st November,
1768. He begins with David: "He still shows the same talents and temper,
and an attention and keenness for what he is employed about, and might
go very far in any profession if he was properly directed, and quite in
a different manner from any of the rest, particularly from Josey, whose
trifling superficial talents makes him never apply to any thing
thoroughly, nor do I ever expect he will. He this winter is at Mr.
Ferguson and Blair's classes, and the Italian, which completes his
university education. I am totally at a loss what to do with him after.
Law will never do with him. The army he inclines not to, though that, as
he has address and behaviour, is best calculated for him."&mdash;MS. R.S.E.</p>

superior to his former work. He is a little deaf at present, which I
have told him is a thorn in the flesh wisely sent him, that he may not
be too much lifted up with hearing the voice of applause. Your History
of England, and his as an introduction to the History of Europe, form a
perfect historical library. I congratulate myself on living in an age,
when our own country and our friends have done such honour to
literature. For myself I continue piddling still about my Lectures."</p>

<p class="center">1771-1776. Æt. 60-65.</p>

</div>


<p class="section">It is to the period from the year 1770 to his death, when he lived among
his early friends in Edinburgh, that we ought to refer such traditional
accounts of Hume's private life and social habits, as are not expressly
connected with any known event in his history. He was, it is true, a
distinguished man when he left his native city, in 1763. He had then,
indeed, performed all the services which entitled him to immortality.
But his foreign celebrity, and his official honours, had since added
many ostensible glories to his name, and introduced him to a wider
sphere of public notice than the substantial fruits of his genius and
industry would have of themselves secured. When we remember that this
was the most celebrated period of his life, and was the only one of
which persons who are still, or who have lately been alive, could have
any recollection, we naturally refer to it those traditional notices and
incidents which have no distinct place.</p>

<p>The impression of Hume's character, acquired by one who has sought it in
the tenor of his works, and the history of his literary career, is quite
different from that which we derive from those who knew him, and were
connected with the social circle in which he <!-- Page 438 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_438" id="Page_v2_438">[438]</a></span>lived. The former is
solitary, self-relying, and unimpressible even to sternness; the latter
is good, easy, simple, social, and amenable to the sway of gentle
impulses. These two representations are not without a harmony of
principle. In all serious matters, in his projects of literary ambition,
in the philosophy he taught mankind, in all that was to connect him with
posterity and the intellectual destiny of the human race, he was
resolute and uncompromising. But the exhibition of his strength was
reserved for the arena of his triumphs; and in domestic and social
intercourse he put aside his helmet, with its nodding plumes; feeling,
that the intellectual exhibitions suited for <em>that</em> sphere, should
spring from whatever Nature had bestowed on him of sweet, and peaceful,
and kind,&mdash;whatever was fitted to drive rancour or angry emulation from
the bosom, and to render life delightful. Hence, to appear in the social
circle as an intellectual gladiator, does not appear to have been his
wish; he was content if he gave himself and others pleasure.</p>

<p>This view of his character is confirmed by Mackenzie, who, when a young
man, enjoyed the high distinction of mingling in that group, of which he
was the principal figure.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>But the most illustrious of that circle was David Hume, who
had a sincere affection for his poetical namesake,&mdash;an
affection which was never abated during the life of that
celebrated man. The unfortunate nature of his opinions with
regard to the theoretical principles of moral and religious
truth, never influenced his regard for men who held very
opposite sentiments on those subjects; subjects which he
never, like some vain and shallow sceptics, introduced into
social discourse: On the contrary, when at any time the
conversation tended that way, he was desirous rather of
avoiding any serious discussion on matters which he wished to
confine to the graver and less dangerous consideration of
cool <!-- Page 439 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_439" id="Page_v2_439">[439]</a></span>philosophy. He had, it might be said, in the language
which the Grecian historian applies to an illustrious Roman,
two minds; one which indulged in the metaphysical scepticism
which his genius could invent, but which it could not always
disentangle; another, simple, natural, and playful, which made
his conversation delightful to his friends, and even
frequently conciliated men whose principles of belief his
philosophical doubts, if they had not power to shake, had
grieved and offended. During the latter period of his life, I
was frequently in his company amidst persons of genuine piety,
and I never heard him venture a remark at which such men, or
ladies, still more susceptible than men, could take
offence.<a name="FNanchor_439:1_400" id="FNanchor_439:1_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_439:1_400" class="fnanchor">[439:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The late Lord Chief Commissioner Adam was another of the young men who
were so fortunate as to be admitted to this circle. In a curious little
collection of notices of eminent persons, called "The Gift of a
Grandfather," privately printed at his own press at Blair-Adam, he says
of Hume:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>He was an intimate friend and acquaintance: and in all the
intercourse of life, and in all he said, and wrote, and did,
when not employed in his unnecessary metaphysical scepticism
(well named, by a friend of mine, intellectual rope-dancing,)
was innocent, playful, and moral, and most natural in his
conversation: equally pleasing and instructive to the young
and old of both sexes.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p>

<p>His simple unaffected nature, and kindly disposition, exalted
him as much as the singular powers of his mind, and his
talents for expressing in writing what he contemplated&mdash;so
well described by Gibbon, as careless inimitable beauties of
style; which, when he read, he laid down the book in despair
that he should ever be able to imitate them.</p>

<p>I have before shown that he never introduced, in conversation,
his abstruse or sceptical speculations; that all his
sentiments were moral and natural and pleasing, and even
playful in the extreme. This is evinced by his letters, which
are perfect in their kind. He could bring himself down,
without <!-- Page 440 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_440" id="Page_v2_440">[440]</a></span>effort, to the most familiar playfulness with young
persons, and particularly delighted in the conversation of
youthful females.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume was one of our constant visiters, making, as was the
custom of those days, tea-time the hour of calling. In the
summer he would often stroll to my father's beautiful villa of
North Merchiston. On one occasion&mdash;I was then a boy of
thirteen&mdash;he, missing my mother, made his tea-drinking good
with two or three young ladies of eighteen or nineteen, (his
acquaintances,) who were my mother's guests. I recollect
perfectly how agreeably he talked to them; and my recollection
has been rendered permanent by an occurrence which caused some
mirth and no mischief.</p>

<p>When the philosopher was amusing himself in conversation with
the young ladies, the chair began to give way under him, and
gradually brought him to the floor.</p>

<p>The damsels were both alarmed and amused, when Mr. Hume,
recovering himself, and getting upon his legs, said in his
broad Scotch tone, but in English words, (for he never used
Scotch,) "Young ladies, you must tell Mr. Adam to keep
stronger chairs for heavy philosophers."</p>

<p>This simple story is a good specimen of the man. He was above
all affectation. I was a companion of his eldest nephew, and
saw much of him when I was very young. As I grew up he used to
invite me to dinner, and I took great delight in his
conversation. I continued in and about Edinburgh long enough
to be able to relish it, and perhaps to join in it. On one
particular occasion I met him at tea at Professor Ferguson's;
it was at the period of my attending Dr. Blair's class on
rhetoric and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">belles lettres</span>: their conversation became very
interesting to me, as it bore upon subjects which had an
affinity to what I was in the habit of hearing prelected upon.
They discussed particularly the Henriade of Voltaire; they
were not displeased with any want of brilliancy in the
versification, but they condemned the choice of the subject.
Mr. Hume said, "He should never choose for an epic poem
history, the truth of which is well known; for no fiction can
come up to the interest of the actual story and incidents of
the singular life of Henry IV.;" and Professor Ferguson added,
"What epic poet could improve upon the chivalrous <!-- Page 441 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_441" id="Page_v2_441">[441]</a></span>life of
Chevalier Bayard, or on the event of his extraordinary
romantic death?"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>"I always lived," says James Boswell, in a passage where he has to
record some of his great patron's expressions of contempt and dislike,
"on good terms with Mr. Hume, though I have frankly told him I was not
clear that it was right of me to keep company with him; 'but,' said I,
'how much better are you than your books!' He was cheerful, obliging,
and instructive. He was charitable to the poor;<a name="FNanchor_441:1_401" id="FNanchor_441:1_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_441:1_401" class="fnanchor">[441:1]</a> and many an
agreeable hour have I passed with him."</p>

<p>The testimony which Adam Smith bore to his character and disposition, in
the letter which accompanies his autobiography, though so well known,
must not here be omitted.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>His temper seemed to be more happily balanced, if I may be
allowed such an expression, than that perhaps of any other man
I have ever known. Even in the lowest state of his fortune,
his great and necessary frugality never hindered him from
exercising, upon proper occasions, acts both of charity and
generosity. It was a frugality founded, not upon avarice, but
upon the love of independency. The extreme gentleness of his
nature never weakened either the firmness of his mind, or the
steadiness of his resolutions. His constant pleasantry was the
genuine effusion of good nature and good humour; tempered with
delicacy and modesty, and without even the slightest tincture
of malignity, so frequently the disagreeable source of what is
called wit in other men. It never was the meaning of his
raillery to mortify; and, therefore, far from offending, it
seldom failed to please and delight, even those who were the
objects of it. To his friends, who were frequently the objects
of it, there was not, perhaps, any one of all his great and
amiable <!-- Page 442 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_442" id="Page_v2_442">[442]</a></span>qualities which contributed more to endear his
conversation. And that gaiety of temper, so agreeable in
society, but which is so often accompanied with frivolous and
superficial qualities, was, in him, certainly attended with
the most severe application, the most extensive learning, the
greatest depth of thought, and a capacity in every respect the
most comprehensive. Upon the whole, I have always considered
him, both in his lifetime, and since his death, as approaching
as nearly to the idea of a perfectly wise and virtuous man,
as, perhaps, the nature of human frailty will permit.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Of any description of his character, his own account of it must form a
material feature. The mere circumstance that a man should have thus
written about himself, is a noticeable element in his mental history. He
says, in his "own life:"</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>To conclude, historically, with my own character. I am, or
rather was, (for that is the style I must now use in speaking
of myself, which emboldens me the more to speak my
sentiments,)&mdash;I was, I say, a man of mild disposition, of
command of temper, of an open, social, and cheerful humour,
capable of attachment, but little susceptible of enmity, and
of great moderation in all my passions. Even my love of
literary fame, my ruling passion, never soured my temper,
notwithstanding my frequent disappointments. My company was
not unacceptable to the young and careless, as well as to the
studious and literary; and as I took a particular pleasure in
the company of modest women, I had no reason to be displeased
with the reception I met with from them. In a word, though
most men, any wise eminent, have found reason to complain of
calumny, I never was touched, or even attacked by her baleful
tooth: and though I wantonly exposed myself to the rage of
both civil and religious factions, they seemed to be disarmed,
in my behalf, of their wonted fury. My friends never had
occasion to vindicate any one circumstance of my character and
conduct: not but that the zealots, we may well suppose, would
have been glad to invent and propagate any story to my
disadvantage, but they could never find any which they thought
would wear the face of probability. I cannot say there is no
vanity in making this <!-- Page 443 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_443" id="Page_v2_443">[443]</a></span>funeral oration of myself, but I hope
it is not a misplaced one; and this is a matter of fact which
is easily cleared and ascertained.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have here a generous testimony to the tolerant spirit of his age: And
yet his history and correspondence show, that he did not always feel
himself safe from the influence of political or polemical resentment. He
seemed, however, to take a pride in contrasting his own personal
reception, by the world, with that of his writings; the one being all
courtesy, the other all prejudice and dislike. A late eminent judge
remembered meeting him at dinner with Black, Smith, and others, a few
months before his death. Smith was speaking of the ingratitude,
perversity, and intolerance of human nature. Hume said he differed with
him. There was he, who had written on history, on politics, and on
morals&mdash;some said on divinity; yet, in discussing these exciting topics,
he had not made a single enemy; unless, indeed, all the Whigs, and all
the Tories, and all the Christians! As, in his playful conversation
among his intimate friends, he was inclined to indulge in practical
humour, he made the general unpopularity of his opinions a common theme
of amusement; picturesquely exaggerating the more offensive features,
and exhibiting them as bugbears to frighten the well-meaning. Asking his
friend, Clephane, to look for lodgings for him in London, he represents
the person who is to inhabit them as "a sober, discreet, virtuous,
frugal, regular, quiet, good-natured man&mdash;of a bad character." This "bad
character," he seems to have occasionally used as a method of gently
alarming innocent females. A lady, of strictly evangelical principles,
walking home from church, through a crowded part of Edinburgh, was
rather surprised by the zealous attention with which he proffered his
arm. After they had <!-- Page 444 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_444" id="Page_v2_444">[444]</a></span>passed through the crowd, he gave his reason for
being so obsequious&mdash;it was, that she might be congratulated, by her
friends, on having been seen walking on Sunday with "Hume the Deist."
Mackenzie relates the following incident, which shows that he was not,
however, always proof against the effect of jocular attacks on his
principles by others.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>In the same <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonhommie</i>, Mr. Hume bore with perfect good
nature the pleasantries which humorous deductions from his
theoretical scepticisms sometimes produced. Once, I have been
told, he was in a small degree ruffled by a witticism of Mr.
John Home's, who, though always pleasant, and often lively,
seldom produced what might be termed or repeated as wit. The
clerk of an eminent banker in Edinburgh, a young man of
irreproachable conduct, and much in the confidence of his
master, eloped with a considerable sum with which he had been
intrusted. The circumstance was mentioned at a dinner where
the two Humes, the historian and the poet, and several of
their usual friendly circle, were present. David Hume spoke of
it as a kind of moral problem, and wondered what could induce
a man of such character and habits as this clerk was said to
possess, thus to incur, for an inconsiderable sum, the guilt
and the infamy of such a transaction. "I can easily account
for it," said his friend, John Home, "from the nature of his
studies, and the kind of books which he was in the habit of
reading." "What were they?" said the philosopher. "Boston's
Fourfold State," rejoined the poet, "and Hume's Essays." David
was more hurt by the joke than was usual with him; probably
from the singular conjunction of the two works, which formed,
according to his friend's account, the library of the
unfortunate young man.<a name="FNanchor_444:1_402" id="FNanchor_444:1_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_444:1_402" class="fnanchor">[444:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>As appropriate to his popularity among women and young people, the
following anecdotes from the pen of one who has gained no little
celebrity by her genius, cannot fail to give interest. They are
contained in a <!-- Page 445 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_445" id="Page_v2_445">[445]</a></span>letter by Lady Anne Lindsay, authoress of the song <cite>Auld
Robin Gray</cite> , when she was a young lady living in her grandmother's house
in Edinburgh, to her sister Margaret:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Dinners go on as usual, which, being monopolized by the
divines, wits, and writers of the present day, are not
unjustly called the Dinners of the Eaterati, by Lord Kellie,
who laughs at his own pun till his face is purple.</p>

<p>Our friend, David Hume, along with his friend, Principal
Robertson, continue to maintain their ground at these
convivial meetings. To see the lion and the lamb lying down
together, the deist and the doctor, is extraordinary; it makes
one hope that some day Hume will say to him, "Thou almost
persuadest me to be a Christian." He is a constant morning
visiter of ours. My mother jested him lately on a circumstance
which had a good deal of character in it.</p>

<p>When we were very young girls, too young to remember the
scene, there happened to be a good many clever people at
Balcarres at Christmas; and as a gambol of the season, they
agreed to write each his own character, to give them to Hume,
and make him show them to my father, as extracts he had taken
from the pope's library at Rome.<a name="FNanchor_445:1_403" id="FNanchor_445:1_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_445:1_403" class="fnanchor">[445:1]</a></p>

<p>He did. My father said, "I don't know who the rest of your
fine fellows and charming princesses are, Hume; but if you had
not told me where you got <em>this</em> character, I should have said
it was that of my wife."</p>

<p>"I was pleased," said my mother, "with my lord's answer, it
showed that at least I had been an honest woman."</p>

<p>"Hume's character of himself," said she, "was well drawn and
full of candour; he spoke of himself as he ought;" but added,
what surprised us all, that, "plain as his manners were, and
apparently careless of attention, vanity was his predominant
weakness. That vanity led him to publish his Essays, which he
grieved over; not that he had changed his opinions, but that
he thought he had injured society by disseminating them."</p>

<p>"Do you remember the sequel of that affair?" said Hume.</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," replied my mother, laughing: "you told me <!-- Page 446 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_446" id="Page_v2_446">[446]</a></span>that,
although I thought your character a sincere one, it was not
so; there was a particular feature omitted that we were still
ignorant of, and that you would add it; like a fool I gave you
the manuscript, and you thrust it into the fire, adding, 'Oh,
what an idiot I had nearly proved myself to be, to leave such
a document in the hands of a parcel of women!'"</p>

<p>"Villain!" said my mother, laughing, and shaking her head at
him.</p>

<p>"Do you remember all this, my little woman?" said Hume to me.</p>

<p>"I was too young," said I, "to think of it at the time."</p>

<p>"How's this? have not you and I grown up together?"</p>

<p>I looked surprised.</p>

<p>"Yes," added he, "you have grown tall, and I have grown
broad."<a name="FNanchor_446:1_404" id="FNanchor_446:1_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_446:1_404" class="fnanchor">[446:1]</a></p>

<p>It may give us some farther idea of the refined simplicity that made his
conversation agreeable to intellectual and right thinking women, to
observe the manner in which he was addressed in the following very
lively letter from Lady Elliot Murray, the wife of his friend, Sir
Gilbert.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">Minto, 12th October, 1772.</p>

<p>I am resolved to take the reins of government into my own
hands. I don't know what has made me such a humble subservient
animal hitherto. I will dictate from this time forth. I will
give the law, and insist on an implicit obedience to my
superior wisdom; for am I not wiser than the wisest? did I not
foretell what has come to pass, that Mons. De Guigne would not
reach Edinburgh before the middle of this week? and did I not
prove my judgment surpassing that best of historians, who is a
mere pedler in understanding to me? Had he taken my advice, he
need not have jumbled himself seventy long miles over
mountains and plains in one day, and left a family who were
happy in his company, and exchanged the cheering blaze of a
good coal fire, for the dreary glimpses of a clouded moon.
But, however, he had the pleasure of gratifying a sense which
few people are much troubled with, a delicacy and <!-- Page 447 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_447" id="Page_v2_447">[447]</a></span>ardour in
politeness; and as that is pretty near akin to benevolence, I
believe the indulgence of it may be a full recompense for the
trouble. But that last principle will lead you back the road
you went; for you left three ladies mourning for your
departure, and the good man of the house has been in a
vexation ever since, and can only be contented by a renewal of
your kind intentions towards us, of passing some quiet days
under our roof. Sir Gilbert came home from Jedburgh, and had
seen your brother there, who told him he would find you here
when he came back.</p>

<p>Enter Sir Gilbert. Where is Mr. Hume?&mdash;Answer: He is gone.
When did he come?&mdash;About one o'clock. And when did he go
away?&mdash;About five. What! have you quarrelled?&mdash;Yes. He and I
had some little difference about his <em>byeuks</em>, and I tried to
persuade him to burn them all, and write the other way; for,
as I said, I was sure he would be a shining light, and equal
the author of the "Pilgrim's Progress," or Mr. Ebenezer
Erskine, if he would only take the right side; and he flew in
a passion and went away in a huff! How could you think he
would be persuaded by you? Pooh! though I am but a simple
woman, before it be long he may be convinced I can see farther
into a millstone than he can do; and if he had taken my
advice, he might have rested his bones here this night in
quiet, in place of rumbling along in the dark in a post
chaise; and so in other matters too, I might perhaps do him a
service if he would be ruled by me. My dear, how can you be so
wild? And, my dear, where is the harm in telling one's mind,
when you think you can do good by it, to a good worthy
creature that is only a little mistaken or so? Good by it,
what a chimera! but come, there is some other reason than this
for his going away? None that I know; except a fine flim-flam
letter that he received from the French Ambassador, saying, he
expected to have the exquisite joy of beholding him at
Edinburgh to-morrow. Ah, now I understand it. But when does he
come back? Why he either comes back with <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons. De Guigne</span>, or
after he has done the last duties to him at Edinburgh. So you
see, if you do not come, you will have brought me in for the
lesser excommunication; for you will have been the cause of my
deceiving my husband, and telling him a lie: although, for
<!-- Page 448 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_448" id="Page_v2_448">[448]</a></span>that matter, neither you nor I <em>lukelly</em> have any thing to
fear now-a-days, for either the greater or lesser
excommunication: For, as you justly observe, line 12, first
page of your letter, how are things changed! Old prejudices
are done away, but behold new ones arise; and the last errors
I am afraid are worse than the first: but, for my own part, I
would willingly have stood before the kirk-session, to have
shown any respect and regard to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mons<sup>r.</sup> L'Ambassador</span>, who is
a man we all esteem in this house, and from whom we have
always received every possible civility, of which we retain a
grateful sense. But we perceive he is travelling in his public
capacity, and unless Sir Gilbert had had it in his power to go
to town to wait of him, and give him welcome from us to our
house, should it suit his conveniency to rest here upon his
road to England, we think any other invitation would appear
improper and abrupt; and as it so happens he cannot possibly
accomplish this at present, for we are to have company with us
most part of this week; and after that we go to our visits,
which will take us most of next week; and then we shall be
chez nous till our journey southwards, when we will require
from you to restore us your good society, else we shall verily
believe your flying visit was all a hum, and we won't be
<em>Humed</em> so!</p>

<p>Bless me, I thought I was writing to my poor good Harry. How
does he do, sanctified soul? I have really hopes of you, now
that he and you are come hand to fist at a conversation; as he
tells me you are very often with him, and he really thinks you
are a saint in your nature; and I say that is a great pity,
for tho' I cannot deny the fact, I deplore it for the
consequences of it; but give my best wishes to him, and tell
him I long to hear of better prospects for him. I am really
confounded, when I think what a parcel of nonsense I have
wrote you: But learn to prefer the truth and sincerity of a
Scots wife, to the pernicious flattery of <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Dames
Françaises</span>, of which you have had enough in your days; and so
it is fit you should be made to hear on the other side of the
head. And so wishing you all health and happiness, and
clearness of understanding, I remain, sir, your well wisher,
friend, and obedient servant,</p>

</div>

<p>Hume had been for many years very corpulent. In a letter to Sir Harry
Erskine, in 1756, he complains of this tendency to obesity. He
occasionally alludes to his partiality for plain food, and to his being,
to use his own sufficiently distinct expression, "a glutton, not an
epicure."<a name="FNanchor_449:1_405" id="FNanchor_449:1_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_449:1_405" class="fnanchor">[449:1]</a> We have found him telling Sir Gilbert Elliot, that for
beef and cabbage, which he calls "a charming dish," and old mutton, no
one could excel him; and that the Duc de Nivernois would become
apprentice to his "lass," to learn how she made sheeps'-head broth. The
zest with which he returned to the simple food of his native country,
after the diplomatic feasts of Paris, seems to have been characteristic
of all his habits. Burke is said to have affirmed, that, "in manners he
was an easy unaffected man, previous to going to Paris as secretary to
Lord Hertford; but that the adulation and caresses of the female wits of
that capital had been too powerful even for a philosopher, and the
result was, he returned a literary coxcomb." But the saying is not <!-- Page 450 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_450" id="Page_v2_450">[450]</a></span>in
harmony with the characteristics noted by others; and it is not quite
clear that it was ever uttered by Burke.<a name="FNanchor_450:1_406" id="FNanchor_450:1_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_450:1_406" class="fnanchor">[450:1]</a> All who speak as having
been familiarly acquainted with him, concur in describing his manners as
kind, simple, and polite. He had, as no one who has read his
correspondence can fail to see, a good heart, ever ready to do
benevolent acts where occasions for their performance came under his
notice; and his exterior appearance and manner corresponded with this
part of his character. One occasionally meets with venerable persons who
remember having been dandled on Hume's knee, and the number of these
reminiscences indicates that he was fond of children.<a name="FNanchor_450:2_407" id="FNanchor_450:2_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_450:2_407" class="fnanchor">[450:2]</a></p>

<p>The broad Scottish pronunciation, in which, by all accounts, he
indulged, was a rather singular habit in one who desired to throw off
all marks of provincialism. Yet we are told that in this rude Doric garb
he clothed a very pure English colloquial style. We must take this
statement with allowances: He never probably in his most finished
writings completely divested his style of Scotticisms; and the English
he spoke must have been pure only in comparison with the language of his
fellow countrymen. But it may be remarked, that provincial broadness of
pronunciation in Scotland is far from being incompatible with a very
pure and unprovincial style of language. It has often been observed,
that in those parts of the country where the speech of the uneducated is
most peculiar, English, when spoken at all, is found in <!-- Page 451 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_451" id="Page_v2_451">[451]</a></span>greatest
purity. Thus, an inhabitant of the border districts makes his southern
tones, though hardly distinguishable from those of his English
neighbours, the vehicle of intense Scotticisms; while beyond the
Grampians, the deep broad Teutonic pronunciation sometimes gives voice
to uncontaminated English, as established by literary and colloquial
rules.</p>

<p>Hume had very clearly two kinds of conversation, one for strangers and
the world at large, the other for his chosen friends with whom he was at
ease, and who could understand the good humour of that jocularity which
a contemporary pronounced to have something in it perfectly infantine.
His friend John Home was somewhat renowned for a warlike and romantic
pomp in his ideas, like those which pervade his own tragic personations.
In Hume's conversation we may believe that there was nothing either
heroic or enthusiastic. A good humoured sly application of the fugitive
subjects of discussion, to the peculiarities of the guests; an
occasional vigorous and apt remark; a fantastic wit sometimes let loose
to wander where it pleased, and choose whatever it thought fit for its
object,&mdash;seem to have constituted the charm of his society. Yet the tone
of his thoughts sometimes rose to enthusiasm. Thus the son of his valued
friend Ferguson, remembers his father saying, that, one clear and
beautiful night, when they were walking home together, Hume suddenly
stopped, looked up to the starry sky, and said, more after the manner of
"Hervey's Meditations" than the "Treatise of Human Nature," "Oh, Adam,
can any one contemplate the wonders of that firmament, and not believe
that there is a God!"</p>

<p>In a late collection of casual reminiscences, there is the following
notice of his social habits.</p>

<p><!-- Page 452 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_452" id="Page_v2_452">[452]</a></span>"Major M&mdash;&mdash;, with whom I dined yesterday, said that he had frequently
met David Hume at their military mess in Scotland, and in other parties;
that he was very polite and pleasant, though thoughtful in company,
generally reclining his head upon his hand, as if in study; from which
he would suddenly recover, however, with some indifferent
question;<a name="FNanchor_452:1_408" id="FNanchor_452:1_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_452:1_408" class="fnanchor">[452:1]</a> extremely inquisitive, but quite easy to himself and
all around him. One is glad to catch personal notices, however slight,
of memorable men and of speculative philosophers. I know no one so
memorable as Hume. He seems to have so far outstripped the spirit of the
times in his original and profound researches, that the world is in no
condition at present to do justice to his merits."<a name="FNanchor_452:2_409" id="FNanchor_452:2_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_452:2_409" class="fnanchor">[452:2]</a></p>

<p>Those who know him solely by his philosophical reputation, will perhaps
believe him to have been</p>

<div class="poem" lang="la" xml:lang="la">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="line">Parcus deorum cultor et infrequens.</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But this does not seem to have been the case, at <!-- Page 453 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_453" id="Page_v2_453">[453]</a></span>least in his outward
conduct. We find him, in writing home from France, casually mentioning
his not having seen Elliot's sons "in church;" and on another occasion
making a like allusion, indicative of his having been a pretty regular
attendant at the ambassador's chapel. He is said to have been fond of
Dr. Robertson's preaching, and not averse to that of his colleague and
opponent, John Erskine. A lady, distinguished in literature, remembers
that in a conversation with a respectable tradesman's wife, who had been
a servant to Hume, she said that her master one day asked her very
seriously, why she was never seen in church, where he had provided seats
for all his household. At that time there were very few of the humbler
classes in Edinburgh, who did not belong to the Church of Scotland. The
woman's defence was, that she belonged to a dissenting congregation; and
it was admitted to be quite satisfactory.</p>

<p>Social in his habits, and living the life of a wealthy bachelor, it was
natural that Hume should connect himself with the societies, whether of
a literary or convivial character, which brought the good company of
Edinburgh together. He appears to have been a pretty active member of
the Philosophical Society. In a letter, of which part has already been
printed, and which would probably in strict chronological order belong
to an earlier period, we find him with mild dignity enforcing the
tolerance and philosophical equanimity, that ought to reign wherever men
of different sentiments meet each other in intellectual discussion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Tuesday Forenoon.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I am so great a lover of peace, that I am resolved to
drop this matter altogether, and not to insert a syllable in
the Preface, which can have a <!-- Page 454 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_454" id="Page_v2_454">[454]</a></span>reference to your Essay. The
truth is, I could take no revenge but such a one as would have
been a great deal too cruel, and much exceeding the offence:
for, though most authors think, that a contemptuous manner of
treating their writings is but slightly revenged by hurting
the personal character and the honour of their antagonists, I
am very far from that opinion. Besides, I am as certain as I
can be of any thing, (and I am not such a sceptic as you may
perhaps imagine,) that your inserting such remarkable
alterations in the printed copy, proceeded entirely from
precipitancy and passion, not from any formed intention of
deceiving the Society. I would not take advantage of such an
incident to throw a slur on a man of merit, whom I esteem,
though I might have reason to complain of him.</p>

<p>"When I am abused by such a fellow as Warburton, whom I
neither know nor care for, I can laugh at him. But if Dr.
Stewart approaches any way towards the same style of writing,
I own it vexes me; because I conclude, that some unguarded
circumstance of my conduct, though contrary to my intention,
had given occasion to it.</p>

<p>"As to your situation with regard to Lord Kames, I am not so
good a judge. I only think that you had so much the better of
the argument, that you ought, upon that account, to have been
more reserved in your expressions. All raillery ought to be
avoided in philosophical argument, both because it is
unphilosophical, and because it cannot but be offensive, let
it be ever so gentle. What, then, must we think with regard to
so many insinuations of irreligion, to which Lord Kames's
paper gave not the least occasion? This spirit of the
inquisitor is, in you, the effect of passion, and what a
<em>cool</em> moment <!-- Page 455 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_455" id="Page_v2_455">[455]</a></span>would easily correct. But where it predominates
in the character, what ravages has it committed on reason,
virtue, truth, liberty, and every thing that is valuable among
mankind! I shall now speak a word as to the justness of your
censure with regard to myself after these remarks on the
manner of it. I have no scruple of confessing my mistakes. You
see I have owned that I think Lord Kames is mistaken in his
argument; and I would sooner give up my <em>own</em> cause than my
<em>friend's</em>, if I thought that imputation of any consequence to
a man's character.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<a name="FNanchor_455:1_410" id="FNanchor_455:1_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_455:1_410" class="fnanchor">[455:1]</a></p>

<p>"As I am resolved to drop this matter entirely from the
Preface, so I hope to persuade Lord Kames to be entirely
silent with regard to it in our meeting. But in case I should
not prevail, or if any body else start the subject, I think it
better that some of your friends should be there, and be
prepared to mollify the matter. If I durst pretend to advise,
I should think it better you yourself were absent, unless you
bring a greater spirit of composition than you express in your
letter. I am persuaded that whatever a person of Mr. Monro's
authority proposes will be agreed to: though I must beg leave
to differ from his judgment in proposing to alter two pages.
That chiefly removes the offence given to me; but what regards
Lord Kames is so interwoven with the whole discourse, that
there is not now any possibility of altering it. I am, sir,
your most obedient humble servant," &amp;c.</p>

<p>"P. S.&mdash;I hope you are very zealous in promoting the sale of
Blacklock's Poems. I will never be reconciled to you unless
you dispose of at least a score of them; and make your friends
Sir John Maxwell and Lord Buchan pay a guinea a piece for
their copy."<a name="FNanchor_455:2_411" id="FNanchor_455:2_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_455:2_411" class="fnanchor">[455:2]</a></p>
</div>

<p><!-- Page 456 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_456" id="Page_v2_456">[456]</a></span>The Poker Club, occasionally mentioned in these pages, seems to have
had no other direct and specific object but the consumption of claret.
The duty laid on that national wine, by "the English statesman," so
pathetically commemorated by John Home, was a heavy blow and great
discouragement to the club; but it rallied, and returned to its old
esteemed beverage; and, indeed, it is a somewhat curious circumstance,
that the national taste, created by the early intercourse with France
and the consequent cheapness of French wines, still lingers in Scotland,
where claret is much more generally consumed than in England. The club
met in Fortune's tavern every Friday. It was the practice, at each
meeting, to name two to be, what were called, "attendant members;" an
arrangement, probably, designed to form a nucleus round which those
whose attendance was uncertain, but who might drop in occasionally in
the course of the evening, could form themselves; and to prevent any
general desertion of the club, or, what might be, perhaps, more
calamitous, the accident of any individual finding himself, for the
night, its sole and solitary representative. We find Hume duly taking
his turn in these attendances, and keeping the minutes according to
rotation. On the 20th January, 1775, there is this emphatic entry, in
his handwriting, "As Mr. Nairne was one of the attendant members, and
neglected his duty, the club sent him the bill." <!-- Page 457 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_457" id="Page_v2_457">[457]</a></span>The last meeting of
the club, attended by Hume, appears to have been that of 8th December,
1775.<a name="FNanchor_457:1_412" id="FNanchor_457:1_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_457:1_412" class="fnanchor">[457:1]</a></p>

<p>It does not appear to be necessary that traditional anecdotes, such as
the few we possess of Hume, must either be authenticated, or excluded
from such a work as the present. It seems to entitle them to a place,
that they were current among those who knew his character and habits.
They thus afford all that is expected from such sources&mdash;passing fancy
sketches, recognised as likenesses. Like several others that have
appeared in these pages, as mere traditions, the following anecdote,
which is eminently natural and curious, has no farther authentication
than the general belief, in Edinburgh, that it "was like the man."</p>

<p>About the commencement of his last illness, a female member of the
respectable Berean congregation, in Leith, presented herself at his
door, with the information that she had been intrusted with a message to
him from on High; and, becoming very urgent, succeeded in obtaining
admission. "This is a very important matter, madam," said the
philosopher, "we must take it with deliberation;&mdash;perhaps you had better
get a little temporal refreshment before you begin. 'Lassie, bring this
good lady a glass of wine.'" While she was preparing for the attack,
Hume entered, good-humouredly, into conversation with her; and,
discovering that her husband was a chandler, announced that he stood
very much in want, at that time, of some temporal lights, and intrusted
his guest with a very large order. This unexpected stroke of business at
once absorbed all the good woman's thoughts; and, forgetting her
important mission, she immediately <!-- Page 458 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_458" id="Page_v2_458">[458]</a></span>trotted home to acquaint her husband
with the good news.</p>

<p>There is an anecdote, which has appeared in numerous collections of such
literary scraps, which represents him as having slipped into the boggy
ground at the base of the castle rock, and called to a woman to help him
out. In his unwieldy and infirm state, during his latter years, the
accident is not improbable. The anecdote proceeds to say, that the
female called on had great doubts of the propriety of helping "Hume, the
Deist," out of that slough of despond into which it had pleased
Providence to cast him. "But, my good woman, does not your religion as a
Christian, teach you to do good, even to your enemies?" "That may be,"
said she, "but ye shallna get out o' that, till ye become a Christian
yersell: and repeat the Lord's Prayer and the Belief," a feat which is
said to have been very rapidly performed, much to the worthy catechist's
astonishment.</p>

<p>Some of his witticisms have a tone of sarcastic severity, which he does
not appear to have been disposed to suppress, even when women were the
victims, if it was called forth by affectation or folly. To a celebrated
"fine woman" of his day, who said she was often pestered to tell her
age, and desired his opinion what answer she should give: he is reported
to have said, "Madam, say you are not yet come to years of discretion."
To the same lady, who, when crossing one of the ferries of the Firth of
Forth, during a fresh breeze, was making a loud outcry about danger, he
remarked, with much coolness, that they would probably soon be food for
fishes; "and who," said the frightened belle, probably a little confused
by the horrors of their position, "who will they begin with?" The answer
she received was, "Why, madam, those <!-- Page 459 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_459" id="Page_v2_459">[459]</a></span>of them that are gluttons will
begin with me; those that are epicures with your ladyship."</p>

<p>We now resume Hume's correspondence. The letters of the last five years
of his life, which have been preserved, are comparatively few; a
circumstance which may be accounted for from his living, during that
period, among his correspondents. On 28th January, 1772, he writes to
Smith, that he would be glad to receive a visit from him; but that his
house would be rather dull, from his sister having fever. In
continuation he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"I shall not take an excuse from your own state of health;
which I suppose only a subterfuge invented by indolence and
love of solitude. Indeed, my dear Smith, if you continue to
hearken to complaints of this nature, you will cut yourself
out entirely from human society, to the great loss of both
parties.</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;I have not yet read 'Orlando Inamorato;' but intend
soon to do it. I am now in a course of reading the 'Italian
Historians,' and am confirmed in my former opinion, that that
language has not produced one author who knew how to write
elegant correct prose, though it contains several excellent
poets."<a name="FNanchor_459:1_413" id="FNanchor_459:1_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_459:1_413" class="fnanchor">[459:1]</a></p>

<p>In the following letters, we find several details about that remarkable
revulsion in the state of trade in Scotland, which, at the present day,
is chiefly known by the quantity of decisions on points of bankruptcy
law, with which it filled the Reports.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"St. Andrew's Square, 27th June, 1772.</p>

<p>"We are here in a very melancholy situation, <!-- Page 460 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_460" id="Page_v2_460">[460]</a></span>continual
bankruptcies, universal loss of credit, and endless
suspicions. There are but two standing houses in this
place&mdash;Mansfields and the Coutses&mdash;for I comprehend not
Cummin, whose dealings were always very narrow. Mansfield has
paid away £40,000 in a few days: but it is apprehended that
neither he nor any of them can hold out till the end of next
week, if no alteration happen. The case is little better in
London. It is thought that Sir George Colebroke must soon
stop; and even the Bank of England is not entirely free from
suspicion. Those of Newcastle, Norwich, and Bristol, are said
to be stopped. The Thistle Bank has been reported to be in the
same condition. The Carron Company is reeling, which is one of
the greatest calamities of the whole, as they gave employment
to near ten thousand people. Do these events any wise affect
your theory, or will it occasion the revisal of any chapters?</p>

<p>"Of all the sufferers, I am the most concerned for the Adams,
particularly John. But their undertakings were so vast, that
nothing could support them. They must dismiss three thousand
workmen, who, comprehending the materials, must have expended
above £100,000 a-year. They have great funds; but if these
must be disposed of in a hurry, and to disadvantage, I am
afraid the remainder will amount to little or nothing.
People's [compa]ssion I see was exhausted for John, in his
last calamity, and every body asks why he incurred any more
hazards. But his friendship for his brothers is an apology;
though I believe he has a projecting turn of his own. To me
the scheme of the Adelphi always appeared so imprudent, that
my wonder is how they could have gone on so long.</p>

<p>"If Sir George Colebroke stop, it will probably <!-- Page 461 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_461" id="Page_v2_461">[461]</a></span>disconcert
all the plans of our friends, as it will diminish their
patron's influence; which is a new misfortune.</p>

<p>"On the whole, I believe that the check given to our
exorbitant and ill grounded credit, will prove of advantage in
the long run, as it will reduce people to more solid, and less
sanguine projects, and, at the same time, introduce frugality
among the merchants and manufacturers: what say you? Here is
food for your speculation."<a name="FNanchor_461:1_414" id="FNanchor_461:1_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_461:1_414" class="fnanchor">[461:1]</a></p>

<p>In 1772, Macpherson published a quarto volume, called "An Introduction
to the History of Great Britain and Ireland," of which Pinkerton,

shallow reading, vague assertion, and etymological nonsense, in this

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sir John Pringle</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">St. Andrew's Square, Edinburgh,<br />
<span style="padding-right: 3em;">Feb. 10, 1773.</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;That the present Pretender was in London, in the
year 1753, I know with the greatest certainty; because I had
it from Lord Marischal, who said, it consisted with his
certain knowledge. Two or three days after his lordship gave
me this information, he told me, that the evening before, he
had learned several curious particulars from a lady, (who I
imagined to be Lady Primrose,) though my lord refused to name
her. The Pretender came to her house in the evening, without
giving her any preparatory information; and entered the room
when she had a pretty large company with her, and was herself
playing at cards. He was announced by the servant under
another name. She thought the cards would have dropped from
her hands on seeing him. But she had presence enough of mind,
to call him by the name he assumed; to ask him when he came to
England, and how long he intended to stay there. After he and
all the company went away, the servants <!-- Page 463 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_463" id="Page_v2_463">[463]</a></span>remarked how
wonderfully like the strange gentleman was to the prince's
picture, which hung on the chimney-piece, in the very room in
which he entered. My lord added, (I think from the authority
of the same lady,) that he used so little precaution, that he
went abroad openly in day-light, in his own dress; only laying
aside his blue riband and star; walked once through St.
James's, and took a turn in the Mall.</p>

<p>About five years ago, I told this story to Lord Holderness,
who was secretary of state in the year 1753; and I added, that
I supposed this piece of intelligence had at that time escaped
his lordship. "By no means," said he, "and who do you think
first told it me? it was the king himself, who subjoined, 'And
what do you think, my lord, I should do with him?'" Lord
Holderness owned that he was puzzled how to reply; for if he
declared his real sentiments, they might savour of
indifference to the royal family. The king perceived his
embarrassment, and extricated him from it, by adding, "My
lord, I shall just do nothing at all; and when he is tired of
England, he will go abroad again." I think this story, for the
honour of the late king, ought to be more generally known.</p>

<p>But what will surprise you more, Lord Marischal, a few days
after the coronation of the present king, told me, that he
believed the young Pretender was at that time in London; or at
least had been so very lately, and had come over to see the
show of the coronation, and had actually seen it. I asked my
lord the reason for this strange fact. "Why," says he, "a
gentleman told me so that saw him there; and that he even
spoke to him, and whispered in his ears these words: 'Your
royal highness is the last of all mortals whom I should expect
to see here.'&mdash;'It was curiosity that led me,' said the other;
'but I assure you,' added he, 'that the person who is the
object of all this pomp and magnificence is the man I envy the
least.'" You see this story is so near traced from the
fountain head, as to wear a great face of probability. Query,
What if the Pretender had taken up Dymock's gauntlet? I find
that the Pretender's visit in England, in the year 1753, was
known to all the Jacobites; and some of them have assured me,
that he took the <!-- Page 464 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_464" id="Page_v2_464">[464]</a></span>opportunity of formally renouncing the Roman
Catholic religion, under his own name of Charles Stuart, in
the new church in the Strand; and that this is the reason of
the bad treatment he met with at the court of Rome. I own that
I am a sceptic with regard to the last particulars.</p>

<p>Lord Marischal had a very bad opinion of this unfortunate
prince; and thought there was no vice so mean or atrocious of
which he was not capable; of which he gave me several
instances. My lord, though a man of great honour, may be
thought a discontented courtier; but what quite confounded me
in the idea of that prince, was a conversation I had with
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Helvétius</span> at Paris, which, I believe, I have told you. In case
I have not, I shall mention a few particulars. That gentleman
told me, that he had no acquaintance with the Pretender; but,
some time after that prince was chased out of France, "a
letter," said he, "was brought me from him, in which he told
me that the necessity of his affairs obliged him to be at
Paris; and, as he knew me, by character, to be a man of the
greatest probity and honour in France, he would trust himself
to me, if I would promise to conceal and protect him. I own,"
added <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Helvétius</span> to me, "although I knew the danger to be
greater of harbouring him at Paris than at London; and
although I thought the family of Hanover not only the lawful
sovereigns in England, but the only lawful sovereigns in
Europe, as having the full and free consent of the people; yet
was I such a dupe to his flattery, that I invited him to my
house; concealed him there, going and coming, near two years;
had all his correspondence pass through my hands; met with his
partisans upon <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pont Neuf</span>; and found, at last, that I had
incurred all this danger and trouble for the most unworthy of
all mortals; insomuch that I have been assured, when he went
down to Nantz, to embark on his expedition to Scotland, he
took fright and refused to go on board; and his attendants,
thinking the matter gone too far, and that they would be
affronted for his cowardice, carried him, in the night time,
into the ship, <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pieds et mains liés</span>." I asked him, if he meant
literally? "Yes," said he, "literally. They tied him and
carried him by main force." What think you now of this hero
and conqueror?</p>

<p><!-- Page 465 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_465" id="Page_v2_465">[465]</a></span>Both Lord Marischal and Helvétius agree, that with all this
strange character, he was no bigot; but rather had learned,
from the philosophers at Paris, to affect a contempt of all
religion. You must know that both these persons thought they
were ascribing to him an excellent quality. Indeed, both of
them used to laugh at me for my narrow way of thinking in
these particulars.<a name="FNanchor_465:1_418" id="FNanchor_465:1_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_465:1_418" class="fnanchor">[465:1]</a> However, my dear Sir John, I hope
you will do me the justice to acquit me.</p>

<p>I doubt not but these circumstances will appear curious to
Lord Hardwicke, to whom you will please to present my
respects. I suppose his lordship will think this unaccountable
mixture of temerity and timidity, in the same character, not a
little singular. I am yours very sincerely.<a name="FNanchor_465:2_419" id="FNanchor_465:2_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_465:2_419" class="fnanchor">[465:2]</a></p>

<p>If there should be any doubts of the genuineness of this letter, from
its having first appeared, unauthenticated, in a periodical work, they
will be removed by the perusal of the following answer by Sir John
Pringle, printed from the original manuscript.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Sir John Pringle</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">London, 5th November, 1773.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;I was much obliged to you for your letter of the
10th ult., as it furnished me with sufficient means for
maintaining my credit with Lord Hardwicke, a person I have not
the honour to be well known to; and I had the more occasion
for such a testimony as yours, as the other earl, mentioned in
your letter, has thought proper, (I presume since he has once
more become a courtier,) to deny his knowing any thing of the
story, when one of the company, (where I told the anecdote to
Lord Hardwicke,) inquired of him about it.</p>

<p>Lord Hardwicke, not being in town when yours came to hand, I
charged his intimate friend, Mr. Wray, who was going to visit
him, with it. Yesterday, that gentleman returned, and, with
the letter, sent me a line, expressing his lordship's great
satisfaction in the communication; and with <!-- Page 466 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_466" id="Page_v2_466">[466]</a></span>many thanks to us
both for it. I understand he is very curious in picking up
such historical facts; and, if so, he certainly never met with
any thing of that kind more suited to his genius. The most
extraordinary circumstance is, that of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pied et poing
liés</i>; and yet your authority seems to be unexceptionable.
What could be expected from an adventurer whom they had been
obliged to treat in that humiliating manner? and whose
timidity, they must believe, was every now and then to recur,
to affront those that set him upon the enterprise? I know that
<em>our</em> people were at great pains to decry his courage, after
the battle of Culloden; but that I considered always as done
upon a political, rather than an historical principle. I had
good evidence for believing that, at Derby, he was, of the
council of war, the person who stood longest out against the
motion for returning, and not advancing to London. Again, he
was for standing at the Spey; and, lastly, he did not retire
from Culloden till his whole band was put to flight. It is
true he never advanced nearer than the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">corps de réserve</span>; but
which corresponded to our second line, in which the Duke of
Cumberland placed himself. I may add, that both of us have
been informed, that he betrayed no unmanly concern, when he
skulked so long with his female heroine; and then, surely, he
was daily in the greatest danger of his life; had he been
taken he would have met with no quarter. But, after all, these
testimonies, in favour of his courage, must yield to such
proofs as you bring to the contrary.<a name="FNanchor_466:1_420" id="FNanchor_466:1_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_466:1_420" class="fnanchor">[466:1]</a></p>

neglect them. The other is Lord Monboddo's treatise <!-- Page 467 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_467" id="Page_v2_467">[467]</a></span>on the

thought to be the immediate cause of this event.</p>

<p>"Have you seen Macpherson's Homer? It is hard to tell whether
the attempt or the execution be worse. I hear he is employed

</div>

<p>We have found Gilbert Stuart deferentially courting Hume's notice of his
earlier literary efforts. A few years of popularity as an author, and
the <!-- Page 468 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_468" id="Page_v2_468">[468]</a></span>command of a periodical work, had in the meantime changed the man's
character, by developing all its arrogance, jealousy, conceit, and
vindictiveness. He was one of those who indulge in the comfortable
consciousness, that any comparison between their own genius and that of
any other given person is supremely ludicrous; and as some one said of
La Harpe, it might have proved a good speculation to buy him at what he
was worth, and sell him at his own estimate of his value. Sick of the
praises he heard bestowed on Robertson and the other eminent historians
of his age, he thought it his duty to show the world how the lamp of
such industrious drudges would grow pale before the lustre of true
genius; and thus he favoured the public with some historical efforts, in
which the curious reader of the present day, who takes them from
forgotten shelves, is somewhat surprised to find how effectually
well-turned periods, and a certain audacity of opinion, keep out of view
the meagreness of the author's inquiries.</p>

<p>In 1773, Stuart began to edit the <cite>Edinburgh Magazine and Review</cite> .
Periodical literature was the proper sphere for exhibiting his powers;
which consisted in the ready acquisition of a superficial view of any
subject, and a rapid, yet elegant style; occasionally magniloquent, and
at other times descriptive or sarcastic. No other periodical work of
that day equalled the <cite>Edinburgh Magazine and Review</cite> , in genius and
originality. But the editor made it the vehicle of his tyrannical and
vindictive spirit; and the purse and person of the proprietor&mdash;it might
almost be said the peace of society, were endangered by so formidable a
weapon remaining in such hands.<a name="FNanchor_468:1_424" id="FNanchor_468:1_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_468:1_424" class="fnanchor">[468:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 469 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_469" id="Page_v2_469">[469]</a></span>At this time, the Rev. Robert Henry was publishing his valuable History
of Britain, volume by volume. Stuart had vowed that he would crush this
work; and the critical columns he concentrated against it, do great
credit to his ability as a tactician. Hume was promised the privilege of
reviewing the book in <em>the Magazine</em>, and probably Stuart thought that
to arm him against an interloper in his own province was excellent
policy; but when the article was written, and put in proof, it was found
not adapted to the editor's purpose. We find him thus writing to a
confederate:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>David Hume wants to review Henry; but that task is so
precious, that I will undertake it myself. Moses, were he to
ask it as a favour, should not have it: yea, not even the man
after God's own heart. I wish I could transport myself to
London, to review him for the <cite>Monthly</cite> : a fire there and in
the <cite>Critical</cite> , would perfectly annihilate him. Could you do
nothing in the latter? To the former I suppose David Hume has
transcribed the criticism he intended for us. It is precious
and would divert you. I keep a <em>proof</em> of <!-- Page 470 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_470" id="Page_v2_470">[470]</a></span>it in my cabinet
for the amusement of friends. This great philosopher begins to
dote.<a name="FNanchor_470:1_425" id="FNanchor_470:1_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_470:1_425" class="fnanchor">[470:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>A review of Henry's work <em>did</em> appear in <cite>The Monthly Review</cite> , but from
a very different pen. The <em>proof</em>, however, which gave Stuart so much
amusement, has fortunately been preserved. After giving a favourable
analysis of Henry's second volume, it concludes with the following
sentences, in many respects remarkable.</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>The reader will scarcely find in our language, except in the
works of the celebrated Dr. Robertson, any performance that
unites together so perfectly the great points of entertainment
and instruction. It is happy for the inhabitants of this
metropolis, which has naturally a great influence on the
country, that the same persons who can make such a figure in
profane learning, are intrusted with the guidance of the
people in their spiritual concerns, which are of such
superior, and indeed of unspeakable importance. These
illustrious examples, if any thing, must make the infidel
abashed of his vain cavils, and put a stop to that torrent of
vice, profaneness, and immorality, by which the age is so
unhappily distinguished.</p>

<p>This city can justly boast of other signal characters of the
same kind, whom learning and piety, taste and devotion,
philosophy and faith, joined to the severest morals and most
irreproachable conduct, concur to embellish. One in
particular, with the same hand by which he turns over the
sublime pages of Homer and Virgil, Demosthenes and Cicero, is
not ashamed to open with reverence the sacred volumes; and
with the same voice by which, from the pulpit, he strikes vice
with consternation, he deigns to dictate to his pupils the
most useful lessons of rhetoric, poetry, and polite
literature.<a name="FNanchor_470:2_426" id="FNanchor_470:2_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_470:2_426" class="fnanchor">[470:2]</a></p>

</div>

<p><!-- Page 471 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_471" id="Page_v2_471">[471]</a></span>Hume was an early friend of Benjamin Franklin, whom he was instrumental
in introducing to his Parisian friends.<a name="FNanchor_471:1_427" id="FNanchor_471:1_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_471:1_427" class="fnanchor">[471:1]</a> The celebrated
publication of the papers revealing the policy of the ascendency party,
and the scene at the council board, of which Franklin so deeply
cherished the memory, are thus alluded to in a letter to Smith, of 13th
February, 1774:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Pray, what strange accounts are these we hear of Franklin's conduct? I
am very slow in believing that he has been guilty in the extreme degree
that is pretended; though I always knew him to be a very factious man,
and faction, next to fanaticism, is of all passions the most destructive
of morality. How is it supposed he got possession of these letters? I
hear that Wedderburn's treatment of him before the council was most
cruel, without being in the least blameable. What a pity!"<a name="FNanchor_471:2_428" id="FNanchor_471:2_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_471:2_428" class="fnanchor">[471:2]</a></p>

can reckon about twenty people, not including the king, whom
he has attacked in this short performance. I hope all his

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">St. Andrew's Square, Sept. 20th, 1775.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear John</span>,&mdash;Of all the vices of language, the least excusable
is the want of perspicuity; for, as words were instituted by
men, merely for conveying their ideas to each other, the
employing of words without meaning is a palpable abuse, which
departs from the very original purpose and intention of
language. It is also to be observed, that any ambiguity in
expression is next to the having no meaning at all; and is
indeed a species of it; for while the hearer or reader is
perplexed between different meanings, he can assign no
determinate idea to the speaker or writer; and may, on that
account, say with Ovid, "<span lang="la" xml:lang="la">Inopem me copia fecit</span>." For this
reason, all eminent rhetoricians and grammarians, both ancient
and modern, have insisted on perspicuity of language as an
essential quality; without which, all ornaments of diction are
vain and fruitless. Quinctilian carries the matter so far, as
to condemn this expression, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vidi hominem librum legentem</i>;
because, says he, <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">legentem</span> may construe as well with <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">librum</i>
as <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hominem</i>; though one would think that the sense were here
sufficient to prevent all ambiguity. In <!-- Page 476 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_476" id="Page_v2_476">[476]</a></span>conformity to this
way of thinking, Vaugelas, the first great grammarian of
France, will not permit that any one have recourse to the
sense, in order to explain the meaning of the words; because,
says he, it is the business of the words to explain the
meaning of the sense&mdash;not of the sense to give a determinate
meaning to the words; and this practice is reversing the order
of nature; like the custom of the Romans (he might have added
the Greeks,) in their Saturnalia, who made the slaves the
masters; for you may learn from Lucian that the Greeks
practised the same frolic during the festival of Saturn, whom
they called <ins class="greek" title="Chronos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">Χρονος</ins>.</p>

<p>Now, to apply, and to come to the use of this principle: I
must observe to you, that your last letter, besides a
continued want of distinctness in the form of the literal
characters, has plainly transgressed the essential rule
above-mentioned of grammar and rhetoric. You say that Coutts
has complained to you of not hearing from me; had you said
either James or Thomas, I could have understood your meaning.
About two months ago, I heard that James complained of me in
this respect; and I wrote to him, though then abroad, making
an apology for my being one of the subscribers of a paper
which gave him some offence. I was afraid he had not received
mine. The letter of Thomas, I conceived to be only a circular
letter, informing me of a change in the firm of the house: and
having answered it a few days ago, by giving him some
directions about disposing of my money, which proved that I
intended to remain a customer to the shop; it happens,
therefore, luckily, that I had obviated all objections to my
conduct on both sides.</p>

<p>In turning over my papers, I find a manuscript journal of the
last rebellion, which is at your service. I hope Mrs. Home is
better, and will be able to execute her journey. Are you to be
in town soon? Yours without ambiguity, circumlocution, or
mental reservation.<a name="FNanchor_476:1_437" id="FNanchor_476:1_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_476:1_437" class="fnanchor">[476:1]</a></p>
</div>
</div>

<p>Hume, though we have found him censuring the conduct of Franklin, was
opposed to any attempt to coerce America. "I always thought," says Sir
John <!-- Page 477 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_477" id="Page_v2_477">[477]</a></span>Pringle, when writing to him, "you were in the wrong, when you
supposed these colonies wanted only a pretext to shake off their
subjection."<a name="FNanchor_477:1_438" id="FNanchor_477:1_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:1_438" class="fnanchor">[477:1]</a> This subjection he seems to have thought they were
entitled to throw off; for he was far more tolerant of the sway of
individuals over numbers, which he looked upon as the means of
preserving order and civilization, than of the predominance of one
territory over another, which he looked upon as subjugation.
Unfortunately, few of his opinions on this subject can be better
ascertained than by the reflex light of the letters addressed to him, in
answer to his remarks. With Strahan, the eminent printer, he carried on
an extensive correspondence on political matters, of which the letters
on his own side have unfortunately been lost.<a name="FNanchor_477:2_439" id="FNanchor_477:2_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_477:2_439" class="fnanchor">[477:2]</a> The sentiments
which Hume had expressed on the American war, are thus described, by
contrast, in the words of that member of Parliament, to whom Franklin
addressed his celebrated letter of defiance.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">William Strahan</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>I differ from you <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">toto cœlo</i> with regard to America. I am
entirely for coercive methods with those obstinate madmen; and
why should we despair of success? Why should we suffer the
empire to be so dismembered, without the utmost exertions on
our part? I see nothing so very formidable in this business,
if we become a little more unanimous, and could stop the
mouths of domestic traitors, from whence the evil originated.
Not that I wish to enslave the colonists, or to make them one
jot less happy than ourselves; <!-- Page 478 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_478" id="Page_v2_478">[478]</a></span>but I am for keeping them
subordinate to the British legislature; and their trade, in a
reasonable degree, subservient to the interest of the mother
country; an advantage she well deserves; but which she must
inevitably lose, if they are emancipated, as you propose. I am
really surprised you are of a different opinion. Very true,
things look oddly at present; and the dispute hath, hitherto,
been very ill managed; but so we always do at the commencement
of every war. So we did, most remarkably, in the last. It is
perhaps owing to the nature of our government, which permits
not of those sudden and decisive exertions frequently made by
arbitrary princes. But, so soon as the British lion is roused,
we never fail to fetch up our lee-way, as the sailors say. And
so I hope you will find it in this important case.<a name="FNanchor_478:1_440" id="FNanchor_478:1_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_478:1_440" class="fnanchor">[478:1]</a></p>

<p>The following letter, which is not, however, written in a spirit of
entire earnestness or sobriety, has some reference to his views on the
American question.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Baron Mure</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"St. David's Street, Oct. 27th, 1775.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Oh! Dear Baron</span>,&mdash;You have thrown me into agonies, and almost
into convulsions, by your request. You ask what seems
reasonable,&mdash;what seems a mere trifle; yet am I so unfit for
it, that it is almost impossible for me to comply. You are
much fitter yourself. That address, by which you gained
immortal honour, was done altogether without my knowledge; I
mean that after the suppression of the late rebellion. Here is
Lord Home teazing me for an address from the Merse; and I have
constantly refused him. Besides, I am an American in my
principles, and wish we would let them alone to govern or
misgovern themselves, as they think proper: the affair is of
no consequence, or of little consequence, to us. If the
<!-- Page 479 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_479" id="Page_v2_479">[479]</a></span>county of Renfrew think it indispensably necessary for them
to interpose in public matters, I wish they would advise the
king, first to punish those insolent rascals in London and
Middlesex, who daily insult him and the whole legislature,
before he thinks of America. Ask him, how he can expect that a
form of government will maintain an authority at three
thousand miles' distance, when it cannot make itself be
respected, or even be treated with common decency, at home.
Tell him, that Lord North, though, in appearance, a worthy
gentleman, has not a head for these great operations; and
that, if fifty thousand men, and twenty millions of money,
were intrusted to such a lukewarm coward as Gage, they never
could produce any effect. These are objects worthy of the
respectable county of Renfrew: not mauling the poor infatuated
Americans in the other hemisphere."<a name="FNanchor_479:1_441" id="FNanchor_479:1_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_479:1_441" class="fnanchor">[479:1]</a></p>

<p>It has already been said, that Hume appears to have suspected that his
nephew, David, was imbibing republican principles. It is well worthy of
remark, that he does not appear to have considered the training of his
young nephews, in political opinions different from his own, as at all
to be deprecated; and David, to whom the following letter is addressed,
was boarded with Professor Millar, afterwards author of the "Historical
View of the English Government," who had even then shown himself as one
of the most powerful antagonists of Hume's constitutional doctrines. It
must be regretted that the letter is much mutilated; but enough of it is
preserved to show how lightly Hume's political opinions hung on him&mdash;how
little they possessed the character of a creed&mdash;how tolerant he was of
any system of politics which bore the air of philosophy, and how
curiously he could let his <!-- Page 480 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_480" id="Page_v2_480">[480]</a></span>reason vibrate between opinions of the most
opposite character in practical politics.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to his</i> <span class="smcap">Nephew</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 8th December, 1775.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Davy</span>,&mdash;All your letters, both to me and to your father,
have [given] great satisfaction, particularly your last; and,
in return, I must give you [the] satisfaction of telling you,
that Mr. Millar is very well pleased with you, [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] no less
than you with him. He complains only of one thing, which [is
not the] usual complaint of tutors against their pupils; to
wit, that he is afraid you [apply too] close, and may hurt
your health by too assiduous study. I should not men[tion
this] if I had the least apprehension that a hint of this
nature would m[ake you] relax too much. But I cannot forbear
saying, that every day, fair or foul, [you] ought to use some
exercise. Relaxation from [for?] amusement, you may use, [or
not,] as you fancy; but that, for health, is absolutely
necessary. When I was [of your] age, I was inclined to give in
to excesses of the same kind; and I remember [an anecdote]
told me by a friend, the present Lord Pitfour. A man was
riding, with [great] violence, and running his horse quite out
of wind. He stopt a moment to [ask when] he might reach a
particular place. In two hours, replied the countryman, [if
you] will go slower; in four if you be in such a hurry. Bad
health, be[sides other] inconveniencies, is the greatest
interrupter to study in the world.</p>

<p>"I cannot but agree with Mr. Millar, that the republican form
of government is by far the best. The ancient republics were
somewhat ferocious and torn [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] by bloody factions; but
they were <!-- Page 481 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_481" id="Page_v2_481">[481]</a></span>still much preferable to the monarchies or
[aristocracies] which seem to have been quite intolerable.
Modern manners have corrected this abuse; and all the
republics in Europe, without exception, are so well governed
that one is at a loss to which we should give the preference.
But what is this general subject of speculation to our
purpose? For, besides that an established government [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]
without the most criminal imputation, be disjointed from any
speculation, [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] is only fitted for a small state; and any
attempt towards it can, in our [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] produce only anarchy,
which is the immediate forerunner of despotism [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] tell us
what is that form of a republic which we must aspire to? Or
[&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;]stion be afterwards decided by the sword. [One] great
advantage of a commonwealth over our mixed monarchy, is, that
it [would consid]erably abridge our liberty; which is growing
to such an extreme as to be incom[patible wi]th all. Such
fools are they who perpetually cry out liberty, [and think to]
augment it by shaking off the monarchy.</p>

<p>"I have not heard from Josey for some time, which, you may
believe, has produced [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] reflections in some of your
friends. But to show you that you are not forgotten [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] I
showed Mr. Millar's letter to your mother. I am afraid, said
she, that [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] some symptoms of a consumption in poor Davy.</p>

<p>"[I a]m far from thinking Mr. Millar's demands in point of
money unreas[onable.] On the contrary, I believe that I never
laid out money to better purpose.</p>

<p>"[Ha]rrington is an author of genius, but chimerical. No laws,
however rigorous, [would ma]ke his Agrarian practicable. And
as the people have only a negative, the [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] would
perpetually gain ground <!-- Page 482 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_482" id="Page_v2_482">[482]</a></span>upon them. You remember that
Montesquieu says, that Harrington establishing his "Oceana" in
opposition to the English constitution, is like the blind men
who built Chalcedon on the opposite [&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;] to the seat of
Byzantium. I ask your pardon for not writing to you [sooner,]
but beg the continuance of your correspondence. My compliments
to [Mr. Millar,] to whom I owe a letter. I am, your
affectionate uncle."<a name="FNanchor_482:1_442" id="FNanchor_482:1_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_482:1_442" class="fnanchor">[482:1]</a></p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 8th February, 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Tyrtaeus</span>,&mdash;It is a remark of Dr. Swift's, that no man in
London ever complained of his being neglected by his friends
in the country. Your complaint of me is the more flattering.</p>

<p>"Two posts ago, I received, under a frank of General Fraser's,
a pamphlet, entitled <cite>A letter from an officer retired</cite> . It is
a very good pamphlet; and I conjecture you to be the author.
Sallust makes it a question, whether the writer or the
performer of good things has the preference? and he ascribes
the greater praise to the latter. It is happy for you, that
you may rest your fame on either. I here allude to what you
have done for Ferguson.</p>

<p>"But, pray, why do you say, that the post of Boston is like
the camp of Pirna? I fancy our troops can be withdrawn thence
without any difficulty.</p>

<p>"I make no doubt, since you sound the trumpet for war against
the Americans, that you have a plan ready for governing them,
after they are subdued: but <!-- Page 483 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_483" id="Page_v2_483">[483]</a></span>you will not subdue them; unless
they break in pieces among themselves&mdash;an event very probable.

<p>The following letter exhibits a feeling of impatience for the appearance
of the long promised "Wealth of Nations." It shows, in discussing some
questions in political economy, that, with his usual sagacity, Hume
predicted that the loss of British supremacy over America, would not
have that dire effect on our commercial prosperity, which had been
anticipated.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 8th Feb. 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Smith</span>,&mdash;I am as lazy a correspondent as you, yet my
anxiety about you makes me write. By all accounts your book
has been printed long ago: yet it has never yet been so much
as advertised. What is the reason? If you wait till the fate
of America be decided, you may wait long.</p>

<p>"By all accounts, you intend to settle with us this spring:
yet we hear no more of it: What is the reason? Your chamber in
my house is always unoccupied. I am always at home. I expect
you to land here.</p>

<p>"I have been, am, and shall be probably in an indifferent
state of health. I weighed myself t' other day, and find I
have fallen five complete stones. If you delay much longer I
shall probably disappear altogether.</p>

<p>"The Duke of Buccleuch tells me that you are very zealous in
American affairs. My notion is <!-- Page 484 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_484" id="Page_v2_484">[484]</a></span>that the matter is not so
important as is commonly imagined. If I be mistaken, I shall
probably correct my error when I see you, or read you. Our
navigation and general commerce may suffer more than our
manufactures. Should London fall as much in its size as I have
done, it will be the better. It is nothing but a hulk of bad

<p>It is not perhaps uncharitable to suppose, that the following eulogium

one of "the barbarians who inhabit the banks of the Thames."</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Gibbon</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Edinburgh, 18th March, 1776.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;As I ran through your volume of history with a
great deal of avidity and impatience, I cannot forbear
discovering somewhat of the same impatience in returning you
thanks for your agreeable present, and expressing the
satisfaction which the performance has given me. Whether I
consider the dignity of your style, the depth of your matter,
or the extensiveness of your learning, I must regard the work
as equally the object of esteem; and I own, that if I had not
previously had the happiness of your personal acquaintance,
such a performance, from an Englishman in our age, would have
given me some surprise. You may smile at this sentiment; but
as it seems to me that your countrymen, for almost a whole
generation, have given themselves up to barbarous and absurd
faction, and have totally neglected all polite letters, I no
longer expected any valuable production ever to come from
them. I know it will give you pleasure (as it did me,) to find
that all the men of letters in this place concur in their
admiration of your work, and in their anxious desire of your
continuing it.</p>

<p>When I heard of your undertaking, (which was some time ago,) I
own I was a little curious to see how you would <!-- Page 485 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_485" id="Page_v2_485">[485]</a></span>extricate
yourself from the subject of your two last chapters. I think
you have observed a very prudent temperament; but it was
impossible to treat the subject so as not to give grounds of
suspicion against you, and you may expect that a clamour will
arise. This, if any thing, will retard your success with the
public; for in every other respect your work is calculated to
be popular. But, among many other marks of decline, the
prevalence of superstition in England, prognosticates the fall
of philosophy and decay of taste; and though nobody be more
capable than you to revive them, you will probably find a
struggle in your first advances.</p>

<p>I see you entertain a great doubt with regard to the
authenticity of the poems of Ossian. You are certainly right
in so doing. It is, indeed, strange, that any men of sense
could have imagined it possible, that above twenty thousand
verses, along with numberless historical facts, could have
been preserved by oral tradition during fifty generations, by
the rudest, perhaps, of all European nations; the most
necessitous, the most turbulent, and the most unsettled. Where
a supposition is so contrary to common sense, any positive
evidence of it ought never to be regarded. Men run with great
avidity to give their evidence in favour of what flatters
their passions, and their national prejudices. You are,
therefore, over and above indulgent to us in speaking of the
matter with hesitation.</p>

<p>I must inform you, that we are all very anxious to hear that
you have fully collected the materials for your second volume,
and that you are even considerably advanced in the composition
of it. I speak this more in the name of my friends than in my
own; as I cannot expect to live so long as to see the
publication of it. Your ensuing volume will be more delicate
than the preceding, but I trust in your prudence for
extricating you from the difficulties; and, in all events, you
have courage to despise the clamour of bigots. I am, with
regard, &amp;c.<a name="FNanchor_485:1_445" id="FNanchor_485:1_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_485:1_445" class="fnanchor">[485:1]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At length appeared the long looked for work, in which the parent of the
first elucidations of political <!-- Page 486 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_486" id="Page_v2_486">[486]</a></span>economy was to see his own offspring
eclipsed; and to see it with pride. One must be familiar with the
unenvious friendship which Hume ever bestowed, on the fellow countrymen
who joined him in the noble path of philosophical inquiry, to appreciate
the genuine satisfaction with which he thus hailed the appearance of
"The Wealth of Nations."</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 1st April, 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Euge! Belle! Dear Mr. Smith</span>,&mdash;I am much pleased with your
performance; and the perusal of it has taken me from a state
of great anxiety. It was a work of so much expectation, by
yourself, by your friends, and by the public, that I trembled
for its appearance, but am now much relieved. Not but that the
reading of it necessarily requires so much attention, and the
public is disposed to give so little, that I shall still doubt
for some time of its being at first very popular. But it has
depth, and solidity, and acuteness, and is so much illustrated
by curious facts, that it must at last take the public
attention. It is probably much improved by your last abode in
London. If you were here at my fireside, I should dispute some
of your principles. I cannot think that the rent of farms
makes any part of the price of the produce, but that the price
is determined altogether by the quantity and the
demand.<a name="FNanchor_486:1_446" id="FNanchor_486:1_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_486:1_446" class="fnanchor">[486:1]</a> It appears to me impossible, that the King of
France can take a seignorage of eight per cent upon the
coinage. Nobody would bring bullion to the mint; it would be
all <!-- Page 487 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_487" id="Page_v2_487">[487]</a></span>sent to Holland or England, where it might be coined and
sent back to France, for less than two per cent. Accordingly,
Necker says, that the French king takes only two per cent of
seignorage. But these and a hundred other points are fit only
to be discussed in conversation; which, till you tell me the
contrary, I still flatter myself with soon. I hope it will be
soon; for I am in a very bad state of health, and cannot
afford a long delay. I fancy you are acquainted with Mr.
Gibbon. I like his performance extremely, and have ventured to
tell him, that, had I not been personally acquainted with him,
I should never have expected such an excellent work from the
pen of an Englishman. It is lamentable to consider how much
that nation has declined in literature during our time. I hope
he did not take amiss the national reflection.</p>

<p>In April, 1776, the disease of which Hume subsequently died, had made
alarming progress. The little autobiographical sketch, called "my own
Life," was finished on the eighteenth of that month; and he there speaks
of the rise and progress of his disorder, and of his feelings under the
expectation of a speedy termination of his life, in the following
terms:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>In spring, 1775, I was struck with a disorder in my bowels,
which at first gave me no alarm, but has since, as I apprehend
it, become mortal and incurable. I now reckon upon a speedy
dissolution. I have suffered very little pain from my
disorder; and what is more strange, have, notwithstanding the
great decline of my person, never suffered a <!-- Page 488 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_488" id="Page_v2_488">[488]</a></span>moment's
abatement of my spirits; insomuch, that were I to name the
period of my life which I should most choose to pass over
again, I might be tempted to point to this latter period. I
possess the same ardour as ever in study, and the same gaiety
in company. I consider, besides, that a man of sixty-five, by
dying, cuts off only a few years of infirmities; and though I
see many symptoms of my literary reputation's breaking out at
last with additional lustre, I knew that I could have but few
years to enjoy it. It is difficult to be more detached from
life than I am at present.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>It was probably early in the year, and before the disease had made such
progress, as to make his friends in general anticipate its fatal
conclusion, that Dr. Black wrote the following undated letter on the
subject to Smith:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I write at present, chiefly to acquaint you with the state of your
friend David Hume's health, which is so bad that I am quite melancholy
upon it, and as I hear that you intend a visit to this country soon, I
wish if possible to hasten your coming, that he may have the comfort of
your company so much the sooner. He has been declining several years,
and this in a slow and gradual manner, until about a twelvemonth ago,
since which the progress of his disorder has been more rapid. One of his
distresses has been a sensation of excessive heat, chiefly in the night
time, and which was only external, for it occasioned no internal
distress, or anxiety, or thirst."</p>

<p>Black then proceeds to describe with more minuteness, than would be
either pleasing or instructive to unscientific readers, a series of
symptoms from which he infers that the most serious part of his
patient's disorder, is a hemorrhage in the upper part of the
intestines.<a name="FNanchor_488:1_448" id="FNanchor_488:1_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_488:1_448" class="fnanchor">[488:1]</a> He continues,&mdash;</p>

<p><!-- Page 489 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_489" id="Page_v2_489">[489]</a></span>"His mother, he says, had precisely the same constitution with himself,
and died of this very disorder; which has made him give up any hopes of
his getting the better of it." He concludes by saying,&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do not, however, say much on this subject to any one else; as he does
not like to have it spoke of, and has been shy and slow in acquainting
me fully with the state of his health."</p>

<p>In preparation for the event, which could not be far distant, he had
executed a settlement of his estate, so early as the 4th of January. He
left the bulk of his fortune to his brother, or, in the case of his
predeceasing him, to his nephew David, burdened in the latter case with
special legacies to his other nephews and his nieces. He left his sister
£1200. Along with some legacies to a few obscure private friends and to
his servants, he left £200 to D'Alembert, and the same sum to Adam
Ferguson.<a name="FNanchor_489:1_449" id="FNanchor_489:1_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_489:1_449" class="fnanchor">[489:1]</a> He appointed Smith his <!-- Page 490 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_490" id="Page_v2_490">[490]</a></span>literary executor, in the
following terms:<a name="FNanchor_490:1_450" id="FNanchor_490:1_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_490:1_450" class="fnanchor">[490:1]</a> "To my friend Dr. Adam Smith, late Professor of
Moral Philosophy in Glasgow, I leave all my manuscripts without
exception, desiring him to publish my 'Dialogues on Natural Religion,'
which are comprehended in this present bequest; but to publish no other
papers which he suspects not to have been written within these five
years, but to destroy them all at his leisure. And I even leave him full
power over all my papers, except the Dialogues above mentioned; and
though I can trust to that intimate and sincere friendship, which has
ever subsisted between us, for his faithful execution of this part of my
will, yet, as a small recompense of his pains in correcting and
publishing this work, I leave him two hundred pounds, to be paid
immediately after the publication of it."</p>

<p>Smith subsequently refused to receive payment of the legacy; and it was
the cause of a long friendly discussion with Mr. Home of Ninewells, who,
in opposition to his argument, that it was bequeathed as a remuneration
for editorial labours, which by a subsequent alteration of the bequest
did not require to be performed, urged such pleas as this, "My brother,
knowing your liberal way of thinking, laid on you something as an
equivalent, not imagining you would refuse a small gratuity from the
funds it was to come from, as a testimony of his friendship."<a name="FNanchor_490:2_451" id="FNanchor_490:2_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_490:2_451" class="fnanchor">[490:2]</a> But
he <!-- Page 491 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_491" id="Page_v2_491">[491]</a></span>pleaded in vain; and Smith continued to refuse the bequest, with all
the firmness of his unmercenary nature.</p>

<p>Previous to his journey to Bath, which has to be presently narrated,
Hume appears to have informed Smith of the desire expressed in his will,
that he should undertake the publication of the "Dialogues on Natural
Religion." The intimation was probably verbal, as it does not form part
of any letter among Hume's papers. Elliot was opposed to the publication
of this work. Blair pleaded strongly for its suppression; and Smith, who
had made up his mind, that he would not edit the work, seems to have
desired that the testamentary injunction laid on him might be revoked.
Hume, however, before his death, took effectual steps to guard against
its suppression.</p>

<p>Thus, after having good-naturedly abstained, for nearly thirty years,
from the publication of a work, which might give pain and umbrage to his
dearest friends; at the close of life, and when the lapse of time since
it was written might have been supposed to render him indifferent to its
fate,&mdash;because there appeared some danger of its final suppression, he
took decided and well pondered steps to avert from it this fate. Such
was the character of the man!</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Adam Smith</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"London, 3d May, 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Friend</span>,&mdash;I send you enclosed an ostensible letter,
conformably to your desire. I think, however, your scruples
groundless. Was Mallet any wise hurt by his publication of
Lord Bolingbroke? He received an office afterwards from the
present king and Lord Bute, the most prudish men in the world;
and he always justified himself by <!-- Page 492 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_492" id="Page_v2_492">[492]</a></span>his sacred regard to the
will of a dead friend. At the same time, I own that your
scruples have a specious appearance. But my opinion is, that
if upon my death you determine never to publish these papers,
you should leave them sealed up with my brother and family,
with some inscription that you reserve to yourself the power
of reclaiming them whenever you think proper. If I live a few
years longer, I shall publish them myself. I consider an
observation of Rochefoucault, that a wind, though it
extinguishes a candle, blows up a fire.</p>

<p>"You may be surprised to hear me talk of living years,
considering the state you saw me in, and the sentiments which
both I and all my friends at Edinburgh entertained on that
subject. But though I cannot come up entirely to the sanguine
notions of our friend John, I find myself very much recovered
on the road, and I hope Bath waters and farther journeys, may
effect my cure.</p>

<p>"By the little company I have seen, I find the town very full
of your book, which meets with general approbation. Many
people think particular points disputable; but this you
certainly expected. I am glad that I am one of the number; as
these points will be the subject of future conversation
between us. I set out for Bath, I believe, on Monday, by Sir
John Pringle's directions, who says, that he sees nothing to
be apprehended in my case. If you write to me (hem! hem!) I
say if you write to me, send your letter under cover to Mr.
Strahan, who will have my direction."<a name="FNanchor_492:1_452" id="FNanchor_492:1_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_492:1_452" class="fnanchor">[492:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>The "ostensible letter" which was to serve as Smith's justification, if
he should decline to follow the injunctions of the will, is as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"London, 3d May, 1776.</p>

<p><!-- Page 493 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_493" id="Page_v2_493">[493]</a></span>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;After reflecting more maturely on that article
of my will by which I left you the disposal of all my papers,
with a request that you should publish my 'Dialogues
concerning Natural Religion,' I have become sensible that,
both on account of the nature of the work, and of your
situation, it may be improper to hurry on that publication. I
therefore take the present opportunity of qualifying that
friendly request. I am content to leave it entirely to your
discretion, at what time you will publish that piece, or
whether you will publish it at all.</p>

<p>"You will find among my papers a very inoffensive piece,
called "my own Life," which I composed a few days before I
left Edinburgh; when I thought, as did all my friends, that my
life was despaired of. There can be no objection, that the
small piece should be sent to Messrs. Strahan and Cadell, and
the proprietors of my other works, to be prefixed to any
future edition of them."<a name="FNanchor_493:1_453" id="FNanchor_493:1_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_493:1_453" class="fnanchor">[493:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Smith did not absolutely refuse to edit the "Dialogues," but Hume saw
pretty clearly that it was a task that would not be performed by him.
That he was correct in this supposition, appears by a letter from Smith
to Strahan after Hume's death, where he says:</p>

<p>"I once had persuaded him to leave it entirely to my discretion either
to publish them at what time I thought proper, or not to publish them at
all. Had he continued of this mind, the manuscript should have been most
carefully preserved, and upon my decease restored to his family; but it
never should have been <!-- Page 494 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_494" id="Page_v2_494">[494]</a></span>published in my lifetime. When you have read it,
you will perhaps think it not unreasonable to consult some prudent
friend about what you ought to do."<a name="FNanchor_494:1_454" id="FNanchor_494:1_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_494:1_454" class="fnanchor">[494:1]</a></p>

<p>By a codicil to his will, dated 7th August, he thus altered the
arrangement referred to in these letters. "In my later will and
disposition, I made some destinations with regard to my manuscripts: All
these I now retract, and leave my manuscripts to the care of Mr. William
Strahan of London, member of Parliament, trusting to the friendship that
has long subsisted between us, for his careful and faithful execution of
my intentions. I desire that my 'Dialogues concerning Natural Religion'
may be printed and published, any time within two years after my death."
After making the bequest to John Home which is mentioned farther on,
leaving to Blair, Smith, Home, and Edmondstoune, "all of them persons
very dear to me, and whose affection to me I know by repeated proofs to
have been mutual," each a copy of the new edition of his works, and to
Miss Ord, ten guineas to buy a ring, "as a memorial of his friendship
and attachment to so amiable and accomplished a person," the codicil is
signed. There is then a new paragraph appended as follows:</p>

<p>"I do ordain that if my 'Dialogues,' from whatever cause, be not
published within two years and a half after my death, as also the
account of my life, the property shall return to my nephew, David, whose
duty in publishing them, as the last request of his uncle, must be
approved of by all the world."<a name="FNanchor_494:2_455" id="FNanchor_494:2_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_494:2_455" class="fnanchor">[494:2]</a></p>

<p>Both Hume and Smith seem to have thought that Strahan would undertake
the publication as a mere matter of business. But this book, like the
little hunchback in the "Arabian Nights," was a commodity <!-- Page 495 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_495" id="Page_v2_495">[495]</a></span>which every
one seemed anxious to transfer to his neighbour. Strahan declined to
undertake the task, and the "Dialogues" did not appear until 1779, when
they were published by their author's nephew.</p>

<p>Smith cheerfully agreed to undertake the superintendance of the new
edition of his friend's works, then at press. They appear to have been
all in a state of very finished preparation for the press, and an
edition of the "Inquiries" and the miscellaneous essays was published in
1777, from a copy in which the author had completed that removal of
passages of a democratic tendency, which has been so frequently alluded
to.</p>

<p>By the entreaties of several friends, who believed that travelling might
have a favourable influence on his health, Hume undertook a journey to
London towards the end of April. At Morpeth he met with Adam Smith and
John Home, on their way from London, to visit him in Edinburgh, in
consequence of a letter which the former had received from Ferguson, who
says, "David, I am afraid, loses ground. He is cheerful and in good
spirits as usual; but I confess that my hopes, from the effects of the
turn of the season towards spring, have very much abated."</p>

<p>Smith proceeded to Edinburgh, but Home went back to London with his
friend, and fortunately preserved a diary of the journey, so very
interesting, and containing so lively a picture of Hume's state of mind
and habits, that, though already published,<a name="FNanchor_495:1_456" id="FNanchor_495:1_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_495:1_456" class="fnanchor">[495:1]</a> the reader would not
excuse its omission on this occasion.</p>


<div class="bqsmallfont">
<p class="center"><i>Note by</i> <span class="smcap">Mr. John Home</span>.</p>

<div class="bqsmall">
<p>Soon after Mr. Home received the letter from Dr. Ferguson, he
left London, and set out for Scotland with Mr. Adam <!-- Page 496 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_496" id="Page_v2_496">[496]</a></span>Smith.
They came to Morpeth on the 23d of April, 1776, and would have
passed Mr. David Hume, if they had not seen his servant,
Colin, standing at the gate of an inn. Mr. Home thinks that
his friend, Mr. David Hume, is much better than he expected to
find him. His spirits are astonishing: he talks of his
illness, of his death, as matters of no moment, and gives an
account of what passed between him and his physicians since
his illness began, with his usual wit, or with more wit than
usual.</p>

<p>He acquainted Mr. Adam Smith and me, that Dr. Black had not
concealed the opinion he had of the desperateness of his
condition, and was rather averse to his setting out. "Have you
no reason against it," said David, "but an apprehension that
it may make me die sooner?&mdash;that is no reason at all." I never
saw him more cheerful, or in more perfect possession of all
his faculties, his memory, his understanding, his wit. It is
agreed that Smith shall go on to Scotland, and that I should
proceed to Bath with David. We are to travel one stage before
dinner, and one after dinner. Colin tells me that he thinks
Mr. Hume better than when he left Edinburgh. We had a fine
evening as we went from Morpeth to Newcastle. David seeing a
pair of pistols in the chaise, said, that as he had very
little at stake, he would indulge me in my humour of fighting
the highwaymen. Whilst supper was getting ready at the inn,
Mr. Hume and I played an hour at picquet. Mr. David was very
keen about his card-playing.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Newcastle, Wednesday, 24th April.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume not quite so well in the morning&mdash;says, that he had
set out merely to please his friends; that he would go on to
please them; that Ferguson and Andrew Stuart, (about whom we
had been talking,) were answerable for shortening his life one
week a-piece; for, says he, you will allow Xenophon to be good
authority; and he lays it down, that suppose a man is dying,
nobody has a right to kill him. He set out in this vein, and
continued all the stage in his cheerful and talking humour. It
was a fine day, and we went on to Durham&mdash;from that to
Darlington, where we passed the night.</p>

<p>In the evening Mr. Hume thinks himself more easy and <!-- Page 497 --><span class="pagenum"  style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_497" id="Page_v2_497">[497]</a></span>light,
than he has been any time for three months. In the course of
our conversation we touched upon the national affairs. He
still maintains, that the national debt must be the ruin of
Britain; and laments that the two most civilized nations, the
English and French, should be on the decline; and the
barbarians, the Goths and Vandals of Germany and Russia,
should be rising in power and renown. The French king, he
says, has ruined the state by recalling the parliaments. Mr.
Hume thinks that there is only one man in France fit to be
minister, (the Archbishop of Toulouse,) of the family of
Brienne. He told me some curious anecdotes with regard to this
prelate; that he composed and corrected without writing; that
Mr. Hume had heard him repeat an elegant oration of an hour
and a quarter in length, which he had never written. Mr. Hume,
talking with the Princess Beauvais about French policy, said
that he knew but one man in France capable of restoring its
greatness; the lady said she knew one too, and wished to hear
if it was the same. They accordingly named each their man, and
it was this prelate.<a name="FNanchor_497:1_457" id="FNanchor_497:1_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_497:1_457" class="fnanchor">[497:1]</a></p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Thursday, 25th.</p>

<p>Left Darlington about nine o'clock, and came to Northallerton.
The same delightful weather. A shower fell that laid the dust,
and made our journey to Boroughbridge more pleasant. Mr. Hume
continues very easy, and has a tolerable appetite; tastes
nothing liquid but water, and sups upon an egg. He assured me,
that he never possessed his faculties more perfectly; that he
never was more sensible of the beauties of any classic author
than he was at present, nor loved more to read. When I am not
in the room with him he reads continually. The post-boys can
scarcely be persuaded to drive only five miles an hour, and
their horses are of the same way of thinking! The other
travellers, as they pass, look into the chaise, and laugh at
our slow pace. This evening the post-boy from Northallerton,
who had <!-- Page 498 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_498" id="Page_v2_498">[498]</a></span>required a good deal of threatening to make him drive
as slow as we desired, had no sooner taken his departure to go
home, than he set off at full speed. "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Pour se dédommager</i>,"
said David.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Friday, 26th, Boroughbridge.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume this morning not quite so well. He observes, and I
see it, that he has a good day and a bad one. His illness is
an internal hemorrhage, which has been wasting him for a long
time. He is so thin that he chooses to have a cushion under
him when he sits upon an ordinary chair. He told me to-day,
that if Louis XV. had died in the time of the regency, the
whole French nation were determined to bring back the King of
Spain to be King of France,&mdash;so zealous were they for
preserving the line of succession. This evening Mr. Hume not
quite so well, and goes to bed at a more early hour than he
used to do.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Ferrybridge, Sunday, 28th.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume much better this morning. He told me, that the French
nation had no great opinion of Cardinal Fleury; that the
English had extolled him, in opposition to their own minister
Sir Robert Walpole; but that Fleury was a little genius, and a
cheat. Lord Marischal acquainted Mr. Hume with a piece of
knavery which his lordship said nobody but a Frenchman and a
priest could have been guilty of. The French ambassador at
Madrid came to Lord Marischal one day, and told him, that he
had a letter from the French minister at Petersburgh,
acquainting him that General Keith was not pleased with his
situation in Russia, and wished to return to the Spanish
service, (where he had formerly been;) that it would be proper
for Lord Marischal to apply to the court of Spain. Lord
Marischal said nothing could be more agreeable to him than to
have his brother in the same country with him; but that, as he
had heard nothing from himself, he could not make any
application in his name. The French minister still urged him
to write to the Spanish minister, but in vain. When the
brothers met, several years after, they explained this matter.
Keith had never any intention of coming into the Spanish
service again; and if Lord Marischal had applied to the court
of Spain, measures were taken to intercept the letter, and
send it to <!-- Page 499 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_499" id="Page_v2_499">[499]</a></span>the court of Russia. General Keith, who commanded
the Russian army in the field against the Swedes, would have
been arrested, and sent to Siberia; and the moment he had left
the army, the Swedes were to attack the Russians. Mr. Hume
told me, talking of Fleury, that Monsieur Trudent,<a name="FNanchor_499:1_458" id="FNanchor_499:1_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_499:1_458" class="fnanchor">[499:1]</a> who
was his <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">eléve</span>, acquainted him with an anecdote of that
minister and the late French king, which he, Mr. Hume,
believes Trudent had never ventured to tell to any body but
him; and he (David) had never told it to any body but me. Now,
since Fleury, Trudent, and Lewis, are all dead, it may be
told. Trudent took the liberty of observing to Fleury, that
the king should be advised to apply a little more to business,
and take some charge of his own affairs. Fleury, the first
time Trudent spoke to him upon this subject, made him no
answer; but upon his speaking again on the same subject, he
told him, that he had entreated the king to be a man of
business, and assured him that the French did not like an
inactive prince; that in former times, there had been a race
of indolent princes who did nothing at all, and were called
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Rois Fainéants</i>; that one of them had been put into a
convent. The king made no reply; but some time afterwards,
when Fleury resumed the subject, the king asked him, whether
or no the prince that was put into the convent had a good
pension allowed him?<a name="FNanchor_499:2_459" id="FNanchor_499:2_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_499:2_459" class="fnanchor">[499:2]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Hume this day told me, that he had bought a piece of
ground; and when I seemed surprised that I had never heard of
it, he said it was in the New Church-yard, on the Calton Hill,
for a burying-place; that he meant to have a small monument
erected, not to exceed in expense one hundred pounds; that the
inscription should be</p>

<p class="centersc">David Hume.</p>

<p>I desired him to change the discourse. He did so; but seemed
surprised at my uneasiness, which he said was very
<!-- Page 500 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_500" id="Page_v2_500">[500]</a></span>nonsensical. I think he is gaining ground; but he laughs at
me, and says it is impossible; that the year ('76,) sooner or
later, he takes his departure. He is willing to go to Bath, or
travel during the summer through England, and return to
Scotland to die at home; but that Sir John Pringle, and the
whole faculty, would find it very difficult to boat him,
(formerly an usual phrase in Scotland for going abroad, that
is, out of the island, for health.) This day we travelled by
his desire three stages, and arrived with great ease at
Grantham.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Monday, 29th.</p>

<p>From the treatment Mr. Hume met with in France, he recurred to
a subject not unfrequent with him&mdash;that is, the design to ruin
him as an author, by the people that were ministers, at the
first publication of his History, and called themselves Whigs,
who, he said, were determined not to suffer truth to be told
in Britain. Amongst many instances of this, he told me one
which was new to me. The Duke of Bedford, (who afterwards
conceived a great affection for Mr. Hume,) by the suggestions
of some of his party friends, ordered his son, Lord Tavistock,
not to read Mr. Hume's History of England; but the young man
was prevailed upon by one of his companions (Mr. Crawford of
Errol) to disobey the command. He read the History, and was
extremely pleased with it.</p>

<p>Mr. Hume told me, that the Duke de Choiseul, at the time Lord
Hertford was in France, expressed the greatest inclination for
peace, and a good correspondence between France and Britain.
He assured Lord Hertford, that if the court of Britain would
relinquish Falkland Island, he would undertake to procure from
the court of Spain the payment of the Manilla ransom. Lord
Hertford communicated the proposal to Mr. Grenville, who
slighted it. Lord Hertford told Mr. Hume the same day an
extraordinary instance of the violence of faction. Towards the
end of Queen Anne's reign, when the Whig ministers were turned
out of all their places at home, and the Duke of Marlborough
still continued in the command of the army abroad, the
discarded ministers met, and wrote a letter, which was signed
by Lord Somers, Lord Townshend, Lord Sunderland, and Sir
Robert Walpole, <!-- Page 501 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_501" id="Page_v2_501">[501]</a></span>desiring the duke to bring over the troops he
could depend on, and that they would seize the queen's person,
and proclaim the Elector of Hanover Regent. The Duke of
Marlborough answered the letter, and said it was madness to
think of such a thing. Mr. Horace Walpole, Sir R. Walpole's
youngest son, confirmed the truth of this anecdote, which he
had heard his father repeat often and often; and Mr. Walpole
allowed Mr. Hume to quote him as his authority, and make what
use he pleased of it. When George I. came to England, he
hesitated whether to make a Whig or a Tory administration; but
the German minister, Bernstorf, determined him to take the
side of the Whigs, who had made a purse of thirty thousand
guineas, and given it to this German. George I. was of a
moderate and gentle temper.&mdash;He regretted all his life, that
he had given way to the violence of the Whigs in the beginning
of his reign. Whenever any difficulty occurred in parliament,
he used to blame the impeachment of the Tories,&mdash;"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce diable de
impeachment</span>," as he called it.</p>

<p>The Whigs, in the end of Queen Anne's reign, bribed the
Emperor's ministers, not to consent to the peace, and to send
over Prince Eugene with proposals to continue the war.</p>

<p>This anecdote from Lord Bath. Another anecdote Mr. Hume
mentioned, but distrusted the authority, for it was David
Mallet who told Mr. Hume, that he had evidence in his custody
of a design to assassinate Lord Oxford.</p>

<p>Prior, after the accession, was reduced to such poverty by the
persecution he met with, that he was obliged to publish his
works by subscription. Lord Bathurst told Mr. Hume, that he
was with Prior reading the pieces that were to be published,
and he thought there was not enough to make two small volumes.
He asked Prior if he had no more poems? He said, No more that
he thought good enough.&mdash;"What is that," said Bathurst,
pointing to a roll of paper. "A trifle," said Prior, "that I
wrote in three weeks, not worthy of your attention or that of
the public." Lord Bathurst desired to see it. This neglected

<p>Last night, when Mr. Hume was going to bed, he complained of
cold. One part of his malady had been a continual <!-- Page 502 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_502" id="Page_v2_502">[502]</a></span>heat, so
that he could not endure a soft or warm bed, and lay in the
night with a single sheet upon him; he desired to have an
additional covering. Colin observed to him, that he thought it
a good symptom. Mr. Hume said he thought so too, for it was a
good thing to be like other people. This morning he is
wonderfully well; which is visible in his countenance and
colour, and even the firmness of his step. Talking of the
state of the nation, which he continually laments, he
mentioned an anecdote of the former war. He was at Turin with
General Sinclair, after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, and,
considering the superiority which the French arms had gained,
he could not conceive why France granted such good terms to
Britain. He desired General Sinclair to touch upon that
subject with the King of Sardinia. That prince, who was very
familiar with the General, said he was at a loss to give any
account of that matter; but, many years after, when Hume was
minister in France, and lived in great intimacy with Monsieur
Puysieux, Secretary of State, who had negociated the peace of
Aix, Mr. Hume asked him the reason of the conduct of France at
that time? Puysieux told him, that it was the king's aversion
to war; that he knew more of it than any man alive, for, the
year before the peace, he was ordered by the king to propose
pretty near the same terms. He remonstrated against making the
offer; said that at least the proposal should come from
England; and that there was always some advantage to be gained
by receiving, rather than propounding terms. The king was
impatient, and obliged Puysieux to write the letter, (which
General Ligonier carried,) with those terms which next year
were agreed to by the British court. Mr. John Home said he
knew that the King of France promoted the peace of Paris from
the aversion he had to war; and the peace was made at a time
when it seemed impossible for Britain to carry on a war of
such extent, and retain her scattered conquests. Mr. Hume
mentioned another singular anecdote concerning the beginning
of the last war. When a squadron of the English fleet attacked
and took two French men of war, the Alcide and the Lys, Louis
XV. was so averse to war, that he would have pocketed the
insult; and Madame Pompadour said it was better to put up with
the affront, <!-- Page 503 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_503" id="Page_v2_503">[503]</a></span>than to go to war without any object but the
point of honour. It is known, that neither the king nor the
ministers of England wished for war. The French king abhorred
the thought of war!&mdash;What then was the cause? Chiefly the fear
of the popular clamour, and of the opposition, in the Duke of
Newcastle's mind. Mr. Hume thinks Lord North no great
minister, but does not see a better; cannot give any reason
for the incapacity and want of genius, civil and military,
which marks this period. He looks upon the country as on the
verge of decline. His fears seem rather too great, and things
are not quite so bad as he apprehends; but certainly the first
show of statesmen, generals, and admirals, is, without
comparison, the worst that has been seen in this country. I
said to Mr. Hume, that I thought the great consideration to be
acquired by speaking in Parliament, was the cause of that want
of every other quality in men of rank: they do speak readily,
but there are many orators who can neither judge nor act well.</p>
</div>


<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">Wednesday, 31st April.</p>

<p>Arrived in London, where we saw Sir John Pringle, who thought
Mr. Hume much better than he expected to see him, and in no
immediate danger. We staid a few days in London, and then set
out for Bath.</p>

<p>In travelling from London to Bath, we had occasion frequently
to make our observations on the passengers whom we met, and on
those who passed us, as every carriage continued to do.
Nothing occurred worthy the writing down, except Mr. David's
plan of managing his kingdom, in case Ferguson and I had been
princes of the adjacent states. He knew very well, he said,
(having often disputed the point with us,) the great opinion
we had of military virtues as essential to every state; that
from these sentiments rooted in us, he was certain he would be
attacked and interrupted in his projects of cultivating,
improving, and civilizing mankind by the arts of peace; that
he comforted himself with reflecting, that from our want of
economy and order in our affairs, we should be continually in
want of money; whilst he would have his finances in excellent
condition, his magazines well filled, and naval stores in
abundance; but that his final stroke of policy, upon which he
depended, was to <!-- Page 504 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_504" id="Page_v2_504">[504]</a></span>give one of us a large subsidy to fall upon
the other, which would infallibly secure to him peace and
quiet, and after a long war, would probably terminate in his
being master of all the three kingdoms. At this sally, so like
David's manner of playing with his friends, I fell into a fit
of laughing, in which David joined; and the people that passed
us certainly thought we were very merry travellers.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>We have the following account from his own pen of his sojourn at Bath.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Hume</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Dr. Blair</span>.</p>

<p class="letterdateit">"Bath, 13th May, 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Doctor</span>,&mdash;You have frequently heard me complain of my
physical friends, that they allowed me to die in the midst of
them without so much as giving a Greek name to my disorder: a
consolation which was the least I had reason to expect from
them. Dr. Black, hearing this complaint, told me that I should
be satisfied in that particular, and that my disorder was a
hemorrhage, a word which it was easy to decompose into <ins class="greek" title="aimos" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">αιμος</ins><a name="FNanchor_504:1_460" id="FNanchor_504:1_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_504:1_460" class="fnanchor">[504:1]</a>
and <ins class="greek" title="rêgnymi" lang="grc" xml:lang="grc">ρηγνυμι</ins>. But Sir John Pringle says,
that I have no hemorrhage, but a spincture in the colon, which
it will be easy to cure. This disorder, as it both contained
two Greek appellations and was remediable, I was much inclined
to prefer; when, behold! Dr. Gustard tells me that he sees no
symptoms of the former disorder, and as to the latter, he
never met with it and scarcely ever heard of it. He assures me
that my case is the most common of all Bath cases, to wit, a
bilious complaint, which the waters scarcely ever fail of
curing: and he never had a patient of whose recovery he had
better hopes.</p>

<p>"Indeed the waters, in the short trial which I have made of
them, (for I have been here only four days,) seem to agree
very well with me; and two days ago <!-- Page 505 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_505" id="Page_v2_505">[505]</a></span>I found myself so well,
that, for the first time, I began to entertain hopes of a
reprieve. Yesterday I was not so well, from a misunderstanding
in new lodgings with regard to my bedding. My whimsicalness in
this particular surprises Dr. Gustard, and he knows not what
to make of it. By the by, this Dr. Gustard is an excellent
kind of man, very friendly, and I believe very intelligent. He
assures me, as do several others, that the summer is the best
time for Bath waters: and if they continue to agree with me I
shall probably pass here that season. I promised to General
Conway, and Lady Aylesbury, that if I had recovered so much
health as to venture myself in company, I should pass some
weeks of the autumn at Park place. This is the only retardment
I can foresee to my return to Scotland before winter. My
wishes carry me thither; though the grievous loss we have
suffered in friends makes the abode in that country less
pleasing to my fancy than formerly.</p>

<p>"You must have heard of the agreeable surprise which John Home
put upon me. We travelled up to London very cheerfully
together, and thence to this place, where we found Mrs. Home
almost quite recovered. Never was there a more friendly
action, nor better placed; for what between conversation and
gaming, (not to mention sometimes squabbling,) I did not pass
a languid moment; and his company I am certain was the chief
cause why my journey had so good an effect: of which, however,
I suppose he has given too sanguine accounts, as is usual with
him.<a name="FNanchor_505:1_461" id="FNanchor_505:1_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_505:1_461" class="fnanchor">[505:1]</a></p>

<p>"Be so good as to read this letter to Dr. Black and to Mr.
Ferguson. When I write to one, I suppose myself writing to all
my friends: and I also wish to comprehend the Principal in the
number. <!-- Page 506 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_506" id="Page_v2_506">[506]</a></span>Pray tell him that Mrs. Macauley is settled in Bath,
and though her muse seems now to be mute, she is, if not a
more illustrious, yet a more fortunate historian than either
of us. There is one Dr. Wilson, a man zealous for liberty, who
has made her a free and full present of a house of £2000
value, has adopted her daughter by all the rites of Roman
jurisprudence, and intends to leave her all his fortune, which
is considerable.</p>

<p>"Two ladies of my acquaintance have laid a scheme of bringing
Lady Huntingdon and me together, for her or my conversion. I
wish I may have spirits to humour this folly."<a name="FNanchor_506:1_462" id="FNanchor_506:1_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_506:1_462" class="fnanchor">[506:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>On 10th June, Strahan wrote to Adam Smith, to say that he finds in a
letter from Sir John Pringle, giving an account of Hume's health, "that
all the good symptoms that attended his first trial of the Bath waters
are now vanished. His distemper has returned with its usual violence, so
he intends to leave that place and try Buxton."<a name="FNanchor_506:2_463" id="FNanchor_506:2_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_506:2_463" class="fnanchor">[506:2]</a> He seems not to
have attempted this change, but returning straight from Bath, he sent,
on the way, invitations to a party of his friends to meet him at dinner.
The note addressed to Dr. Blair is as follows:</p>

<p>"Mr. John Hume,<a name="FNanchor_506:3_464" id="FNanchor_506:3_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_506:3_464" class="fnanchor">[506:3]</a> alias Home, alias The Home, alias <!-- Page 507 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_507" id="Page_v2_507">[507]</a></span>the late Lord
Conservator, alias the late minister of the gospel at Athelstaneford,
has calculated matters so as to arrive infallibly with his friend in St.
David's Street, on Wednesday evening. He has asked several of Dr.
Blair's friends to dine with him there on Thursday, being the 4th of
July, and begs the favour of the Doctor to make one of the
number."<a name="FNanchor_507:1_465" id="FNanchor_507:1_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_507:1_465" class="fnanchor">[507:1]</a></p>

<p>Thus did this knot of men, united in friendship by the greatness of
their talents, and their superiority to all things small and mean, meet
for the last time round the social board, to bid, as it were, a farewell
to him who had been the chief ornament and distinction of their circle.
The eyes of these affectionate friends sedulously and anxiously watched
the expiring flame&mdash;their pens have recorded the last scenes of its
existence, and leave to the ordinary biographer only the task of
embodying their statements in deferential silence. Nothing, therefore,
remains, but to put together, along with the few remaining letters by
Hume himself, the accounts furnished us by those who had the best means
of knowing the manner in which he spent the last few days of his life.</p>

<p>The following is his last letter to John Home.</p>


<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 6th August, 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear John</span>,&mdash;I shall begin with telling you the only piece
of good news of the family, which is, that my nephew, in no
more than two days that he has staid here, has recovered so
surprisingly, that he <!-- Page 508 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_508" id="Page_v2_508">[508]</a></span>is scarcely knowable, or rather is
perfectly knowable, for he was not so on his first
arrival.<a name="FNanchor_508:1_466" id="FNanchor_508:1_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_508:1_466" class="fnanchor">[508:1]</a> Such are the advantages of youth! His uncle
declines, if not with so great rapidity, yet pretty sensibly.
Sunday, ill; half of yesterday the same; easy at present;
prepared to suffer a little to-morrow; perhaps less the day
after. Dr. Black says, I shall not die of a dropsy, as I
imagined, but of inanition and weakness. He cannot, however,
fix, with any probability, the time, otherwise he would
frankly tell me.</p>

<p>"Poor Edmondstoune and I parted to-day, with a plentiful
effusion of tears; all those <em>Belzebubians</em><a name="FNanchor_508:2_467" id="FNanchor_508:2_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_508:2_467" class="fnanchor">[508:2]</a> have not
hearts of iron. I hope you met with every thing well at Foggo,
and receive nothing but good news from Buxton. In spite of Dr.
Black's caution, I venture to foretel that I shall be yours
cordially and sincerely till the month of October
next."<a name="FNanchor_508:3_468" id="FNanchor_508:3_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_508:3_468" class="fnanchor">[508:3]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 509 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_509" id="Page_v2_509">[509]</a></span>Next in date is the following affectionate and considerate letter to
his nephew.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="letterdateit">"Edinburgh, 15th August, 1776.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Davy</span>,&mdash;You need not doubt but your company, as well as
your father's, would have been very agreeable to me,
especially at present, for the consolation of your company;
but I see the immediate inconveniences that attend it. You
cannot be well spared from Josey, whose state of health, I am
sorry to find, is still somewhat precarious; and there is no
immediate call for your being here. For besides that you would
but pass a melancholy time with me, howeveection
might cover it and relieve it, I am weakening very gradually,
and am not threatened with any immediate incident. I shall
probably have more warning, in which case I shall not fail to
summon you; and I shall never die in satisfaction without
embracing you. I doubt not but my name would have procured you
friends and credit, in the course of your life, especially if
my brother had allowed you to carry it, for who will know it
in the present disguise? But as he is totally obstinate on
this head, I believe we had better let him alone. I have
frequently told him, that it is lucky for him he sees few
things in a wrong light, for where he does he is totally
incurable. I am very much at my ease to-day. I beg my
compliments to all your family. Your affectionate
uncle."<a name="FNanchor_509:1_469" id="FNanchor_509:1_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_509:1_469" class="fnanchor">[509:1]</a></p>
</div>

<p>Of the manner in which he conducted himself when he had come near to the
end of his days, Adam Smith tells us:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>His cheerfulness was so great, and his conversation and
amusements run so much in their usual strain, that,
notwithstanding all bad symptoms, many people could not
believe he was dying. "I shall tell your friend, Colonel
<!-- Page 510 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_510" id="Page_v2_510">[510]</a></span>Edmondstoune," said Dr. Dundas to him one day, "that I left
you much better, and in a fair way of recovery." "Doctor,"
said he, "as I believe you would not choose to tell any thing
but the truth, you had better tell him, that I am dying as
fast as my enemies, if I have any, could wish, and as easily
and cheerfully as my best friends could desire." Colonel
Edmondstoune soon afterwards came to see him, and take leave
of him; and on his way home, he could not forbear writing him
a letter, bidding him once more an eternal adieu, and applying
to him, as to a dying man, the beautiful French verses in
which the Abbé Chaulieu, in expectation of his own death,
laments his approaching separation from his friend, the
Marquis de la Fare.<a name="FNanchor_510:1_470" id="FNanchor_510:1_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_510:1_470" class="fnanchor">[510:1]</a> Mr. Hume's magnanimity and firmness
were such, that his most affectionate friends knew that they
hazarded nothing in talking or writing to him as to a dying
man, and that so far from being hurt by this frankness, he was
rather pleased and flattered by it. I happened to come into
his room while he was reading this letter, which he had just
received, and which he immediately showed me. I told him, that
though I was sensible how very much he was weakened, and that
appearances were in many <!-- Page 511 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_511" id="Page_v2_511">[511]</a></span>respects very bad, yet his
cheerfulness was still so great, the spirit of life seemed
still to be so very strong in him, that I could not help
entertaining some faint hopes. He answered, "Your hopes are
groundless. An habitual diarrhœa of more than a year's
standing, would be a very bad disease at any age: at my age it
is a mortal one. When I lie down in the evening, I feel myself
weaker than when I rose in the morning; and when I rise in the
morning, weaker than when I lay down in the evening. I am
sensible, besides, that some of my vital parts are affected,
so that I must soon die." "Well," said I, "if it must be so,
you have at least the satisfaction of leaving all your
friends, your brother's family in particular, in great
prosperity." He said that he felt that satisfaction so
sensibly, that when he was reading, a few days before,
Lucian's Dialogues of the Dead, among all the excuses which
are alleged to Charon for not entering readily into his boat,
he could not find one that fitted him; he had no house to
finish, he had no daughter to provide for, he had no enemies
upon whom he wished to revenge himself. "I could not well
imagine," said he, "what excuse I could make to Charon in
order to obtain a little delay. I have done every thing of
consequence which I ever meant to do; and I could at no time
expect to leave my relations and friends in a better situation
than that in which I am now likely to leave them. I therefore
have all reason to die contented." He then diverted himself
with inventing several jocular excuses, which he supposed he
might make to Charon, and with imagining the very surly
answers which it might suit the character of Charon to return
to them. "Upon further consideration," said he, "I thought I
might say to him, 'Good Charon, I have been correcting my
works for a new edition. Allow me a little time, that I may
see how the public receives the alterations.' But Charon would
answer, 'When you have seen the effect of these, you will be
for making other alterations. There will be no end of such
excuses; so, honest friend, please step into the boat.' But I
might still urge, 'Have a little patience, good Charon; I have
been endeavouring to open the eyes of the public. If I live a
few years longer, I may have the satisfaction of seeing the
downfal of some of the prevailing systems of <!-- Page 512 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_512" id="Page_v2_512">[512]</a></span>superstition.'
But Charon would then lose all temper and decency. 'You
loitering rogue, that will not happen these many hundred
years. Do you fancy I will grant you a lease for so long a
term? Get into the boat this instant, you lazy loitering
rogue.'"</p>

<p>But, though Mr. Hume always talked of his approaching
dissolution with great cheerfulness, he never affected to make
any parade of his magnanimity. He never mentioned the subject
but when the conversation naturally led to it, and never dwelt
longer upon it than the course of the conversation happened to
require.<a name="FNanchor_512:1_471" id="FNanchor_512:1_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_512:1_471" class="fnanchor">[512:1]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 513 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_513" id="Page_v2_513">[513]</a></span>How much his mind continued to be occupied with all that it had taken
interest in, in the days of his health and enjoyment, the following
letter, written five days before his death, will show:&mdash;</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Though</span> I am certainly within a few weeks, dear madam, and,
perhaps, within a few days of my own death, I could not

great a loss in every particular. My reflection carried me
immediately to your situation in this melancholy incident.
What a difference to you in your whole plan of life! Pray
write me some particulars; but in such terms that you need not
care, in case of decease, into whose hands your letter may

</div>

<p>Smith, proceeding with his narrative, says, "He had now become so very
weak, that the company of his most intimate friends fatigued him; for
his cheerfulness was still so great, his complaisance and social
disposition were still so entire, that when any friend was with him, he
could not help talking more, and with greater exertion, than suited the
weakness of his body. At his own desire, therefore, I agreed to leave
Edinburgh, where I was staying, partly upon his account, and returned to
my mother's house here, at Kirkaldy, upon condition that he would send
for me whenever he wished to see me; the physician who saw him most
frequently, Dr. Black, undertaking, in the mean time, to write me,
occasionally, an account of the state of his health.</p>

<p>"On the 22d of August, the Doctor wrote me the following letter:&mdash;</p>

<p>"'Since my last, Mr. Hume has passed his time pretty easily, but is much
weaker. He sits up, goes down stairs once a-day, and amuses himself with
reading, but seldom sees any body. He finds that even the conversation
of his most intimate friends fatigues and oppresses him; and it is happy
that he does not need it, for he is quite free from anxiety, impatience,
or low spirits, and passes his time very well with the assistance of
amusing books.'</p>

<p>"I received, the day after, a letter from Mr. Hume himself, of which the
following is an extract.</p>

<p>'I go very fast to decline, and last night had a small fever,
which I hoped might put a quicker period to this tedious
illness; but, unluckily, it has, in a great measure, gone off.
I cannot submit to your coming over here on my account, as it
is possible for me to see you so small a part of the day; but
Doctor Black can better inform you concerning the degree of
strength which may, from time to time, remain with me. Adieu,'

<p>"Three days after I received the following letter from Doctor Black:&mdash;</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p class="letterdateit">'Edinburgh, Monday, 26th August, 1776.</p>

<p>'<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Yesterday, about four o'clock, afternoon, Mr. Hume
expired. The near approach of his death became evident in the
night between Thursday and Friday, when his disease became
excessive, and soon weakened him so much that he could no
longer rise out of his bed. He continued, to the last,
perfectly sensible, and free from much pain or feelings of
distress. He never dropped the smallest expression of
impatience; but, when he had occasion to speak to the people
about him, always did it with affection and tenderness. I
thought it improper to write to you to bring you over,
especially as I heard that he had dictated a letter to you
desiring you not to come. When he became very weak, it cost
him an effort to speak; and he died in such a happy composure
of mind that nothing could exceed it.'"</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The world is fortunately in possession of an account of this event, by
another scientific man of no less eminence, the great Dr. Cullen. From a
letter which <!-- Page 516 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_516" id="Page_v2_516">[516]</a></span>he wrote to Dr. Hunter, on 17th September, the following
extracts are made:</p>

<div class="bqsmallfont">
<div class="bqsmall">
<p>You desire an account of Mr. Hume's last days, and I give it
you with some pleasure; for, though I could not look upon him
in his illness without much concern, yet the tranquillity and
pleasantry which he constantly discovered did, even then, give
me satisfaction; and, now that the curtain is dropped, allows
me indulge the less alloyed reflection. It was truly an
example "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">des grands hommes qui sont morts en
plaisantant</span>;"<a name="FNanchor_516:1_474" id="FNanchor_516:1_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:1_474" class="fnanchor">[516:1]</a> and to me, who have been so often shocked
with the horrors of the superstitious on such occasions, the
reflexion on such a death is truly agreeable. For many weeks
before his death, he was very sensible of his gradual decay;
and his answer to inquiries after his health was, several
times, that he was going as fast as his enemies could wish,
and as easily as his friends could desire. He was not,
however, without a frequent recurrence of pain and uneasiness;
but he passed most part of the day in his drawing-room,
admitted the visits of his friends, and with his usual spirit
conversed with them upon literature, politics, or whatever
else was accidentally started. In conversation he seemed to be
perfectly at ease, and to the last abounded with that
pleasantry, and those curious and entertaining anecdotes,
which ever distinguished him. This, however, I always
considered rather as an effort to be agreeable, and he at
length acknowledged that it became too much for his strength.
For a few days before his death, he became more averse to
receive visits; speaking became more and more difficult for
him; and, for twelve hours before his death, his speech failed
altogether. His senses and judgment did not fail till the last
hour of his life. He constantly discovered a strong
sensibility to the attention and care of his friends, and,
amidst great uneasiness and languor, never betrayed any
peevishness or impatience.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<a name="FNanchor_516:2_475" id="FNanchor_516:2_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_516:2_475" class="fnanchor">[516:2]</a></p>

<p>These are a few particulars, which may perhaps appear
<!-- Page 517 --><span class="pagenum" style="font-size: 90%;"><a name="Page_v2_517" id="Page_v2_517">[517]</a></span>trifling, but to me no particulars seem trifling that relate
to so great a man. It is perhaps from trifles that we can best
distinguish the tranquillity and cheerfulness of the
philosopher, at a time when the most part of mankind are under
disquiet, anxiety, and sometimes even horror. I consider the
sacrifice of the cock as a more certain evidence of the
tranquillity of Socrates, than his discourse on
immortality.<a name="FNanchor_517:1_476" id="FNanchor_517:1_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_517:1_476" class="fnanchor">[517:1]</a></p>

<p>The death and burial of so distinguished a fellow citizen, were
naturally the objects of much attention among the inhabitants of
Edinburgh. On the one hand his unpopular opinions; on the other, the
blameless character of his life and his great genius, excited
conflicting opinions, and these giving zest to public attention and
curiosity, attracted crowds to witness his funeral, and to look with
mingled feelings, on the spot where his remains were, by the injunctions
of his will, deposited.<a name="FNanchor_517:2_477" id="FNanchor_517:2_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_517:2_477" class="fnanchor">[517:2]</a></p>

<p><!-- Page 518 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_518" id="Page_v2_518">[518]</a></span>On the declivity of the Calton Hill there is an old grave-yard, which
seventy years ago was in the open country beyond the boundary of the
city of Edinburgh, and even at the present day, when it is the centre of
a wide circumference of streets and terraces, has an air of solitude,
from its elevated site, and the abrupt rocky banks that separate it from
the crowded thoroughfares. There, on a conspicuous point of rock,
beneath a circular monument built after the simple and solemn fashion of
the old Roman tombs, lies the dust of David Hume. Whither the immortal
spirit that gave life to it is gone, let no man too presumptuously
pronounce; but let us rather contemplate with respectful awe, that
unseen essence which the Deity had imbued with so great a power over the
intellects of men, and believe that this wide sway over the destinies of
the human species had its own wise and beneficent design, and was no
produce of malign influences or untoward accidents. Fallacies may be the
brilliant insects of a day, but truth is eternal; and when the searcher
in philosophy groping amid the darkness of man's imperfect reason,
produces falsehoods, they are speedily forgotten; but if he develop
great truths, they live to bless his species for ever. There are few who
will now deny that mankind have learned many valuable truths of David
Hume. The wide influence of his mind over thought and action, during the
last hundred years, is expressed in the mere naming of the systems of
which he was the author or suggester.</p>

<p>His Metaphysical labours gave birth to two great <!-- Page 519 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_519" id="Page_v2_519">[519]</a></span>schools of philosophy.
The one rising at his own door, endeavoured by powerful and earnest
efforts to reconstruct in a more rational and substantial form the old
system which he had sapped&mdash;the other in a distant land, where new
lights of science had begun to burn, sought to raise mental philosophy
from its original elements, purified of the dross and rubbish that had
rendered the old materials cumbrous and unsafe, and to endow the whole
with fresh life and a new form and structure.<a name="FNanchor_519:1_478" id="FNanchor_519:1_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_519:1_478" class="fnanchor">[519:1]</a></p>

<p>In Ethics he was the first to make an Utilitarian morality assume the
aspect of a theoretical system, which it was the task of a great
successor, aided by subordinate labourers, to apply to the practical
operations of mankind, and to spread widely over the earth.</p>

<p>In History he was the first to divert attention from wars, treaties, and
successions, to the living progress of the people, in all that increases
their civilization and their happiness. The example thus set has been
the chief service of the "History of England;" yet, with all the faults
of its matter, its purely literary merits have been so great, that, as a
classical and popular work, it has hitherto encountered no rival.<a name="FNanchor_519:2_479" id="FNanchor_519:2_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_519:2_479" class="fnanchor">[519:2]</a></p>

<p>But his triumphs in Political Economy are those <!-- Page 520 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_520" id="Page_v2_520">[520]</a></span>which, in the present
day, stand forth with the greatest prominence and lustre. In no long
time, a hundred years will have elapsed from the day when Hume told the
world, what the legislature of this country is now declaring, that
national exclusiveness in trade was as foolish as it was wicked; that no
nation could profit by stopping the natural flood of commerce between
itself and the rest of the world; that commercial restrictions deprive
the nations of the earth "<em>of that free communication and exchange,
which the author of the world has intended by giving them soils,
climates, and geniuses, so different from each other</em>;" and that, like
the healthy circulation of the blood in living bodies, Free Trade is the
vital principle by which the nations of the earth are to become united
in one harmonious whole.<a name="FNanchor_520:1_480" id="FNanchor_520:1_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_520:1_480" class="fnanchor">[520:1]</a> Those who, with a reverential eye, have
marked the wonders of the animal structure, and discovered beauty,
utility, and harmonious purpose, where presumptuous ignorance has found
uselessness or deformity; or have seen the lower animals, each working
in its own blind ignorance, gregariously constructing a fabric more
perfect, on philosophical principles, than human science can
create,&mdash;have thence drawn vivid pictures of the wisdom and goodness
with which the world is ordered. May we not extend <!-- Page 521 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_v2_521" id="Page_v2_521">[521]</a></span>this harmony to the
social economy of the globe, and say, that the spirit of activity and
enterprise, harmonizing with the dispersal of the different bounties of
Providence in the distant regions of the globe, are part of the same
harmonious system; that the love of commerce and the desire of
aggrandisement, which in the eye of a narrow philosophy assume the air
of selfish and repulsive passions, represent themselves, when they are
left to their legitimate course, as motives implanted in us for the
great purposes of securing mutual dependance and kind offices, and their
fruits, peace and good-will, throughout the great family of mankind. To
be the first to teach that the earth is not doomed to the eternal curse
of rivalry and strife, and to open up so wide a prospect of beneficence,
may be an atonement for many errors, and in the eye of good taste may
justify the brief assumption of conscious superiority, in which the
subject of this memoir indulged, when he desired that the inscription on
his monument should contain only his name, with the year of his birth
and of his death. <em>Leaving it to posterity to add the rest.</em></p>

that going to sup with Mrs. Cockburn, and not arriving until after the
choice of the good things had been consumed, when some effort was made
to cater for him, he said, "Trouble yourself very little about what you
have, or how it appears; you know I am no epicure, but only a glutton."
Mr. Chambers says, (Scottish Jests, p. 171,) that he took down this
anecdote from one who was present.</p>

<p>These literary parties at Mrs. Cockburn's, appear to have been frequent
and agreeable. A gentleman still living, was present at many of them
when a youth, and particularly recollects one occasion when a tipsy
relative of that lady chose to lock the door of the room where the
walking habiliments of the guests were preserved. A general borrowing of
articles of clothing from surrounding neighbours took place, and those
which fell to Hume's lot, happened to produce a peculiarly ludicrous
effect.</p>

occasionally absent in his habits; but there is no such collection of
practical illustrations of this failing, as we possess in the case of
Smith and others. I only remember having heard of one trifling instance,
of which I had an account from an eye-witness. Hume had been dining with
Dr. Jardine, and there had been much conversation about "internal
light." In descending the stair leading from the Doctor's "flat," when
he left the party, Hume failed to observe that after so many flights
which reached the street door, there was, according to a not uncommon
practice, another flight of stairs leading to the cellars. He continued
his descent, accordingly, till the very end, where some time afterwards
he was found in extreme darkness and perplexity, wondering how it was
that he could find no outlet. The circumstance bore rather curiously on
some opinions he had been maintaining, and Jardine said, shaking his
head, "Oh David! where is your internal light?"</p>

Magazine, seems to have led an uneasy life, between the quarrels and the
dissipation of his editor, of which he has left some picturesque
memorials. Having come one night to Smellie's house on magazine business
in a very advanced stage of intoxication, Stuart was charitably put to
bed. Roused in the middle of the night by an immense outcry from the
awakened editor, Smellie rushed to the bedroom in his night clothes.
Stuart sitting up in bed and glaring around him, immediately associated
the respectable printer's presence with the places in which he was
himself accustomed to waken, and said,&mdash;"Smellie, I never expected to
find <em>you</em> in such a place: put on your clothes, and go back to your
wife and family, I shall never say a word about this." A journey of six
miles, from Edinburgh to Musselburgh, made by Stuart and some of his
companions, in which, by reason of the abundance of good cheer on the
way, they occupied several days, seems to have been fruitful in
adventures. One of the party falling asleep among the ashes of a steam
engine, wakened in the night, and found himself in the presence of a
great red furnace, surrounded by dusky figures clanging bolts and
chains. Associating the exhibition with the course of life he had been
running, and its probable reward, he was heard to exclaim, "Good God, is
it come to this at last!"&mdash;See <cite>Kerr's Memoirs of Smellie</cite> .</p>

a promise is held out, that this arch-infidel is himself to be reviewed

for rebuilding the bridge of Churnside the sum of a hundred pounds; but
on condition that the manager of the bridge shall take none of the
stones for building the bridge from the quarry of Ninewells, except from
that part of the quarry which has been already opened." With reference
to this, Dr. Cullen, in the letter cited, <a href="#Page_v2_516">p. 516</a>, says, "In the
neighbourhood of his brother's house, in Berwickshire, is a brook, by
which the access in time of floods is frequently interrupted. Mr. Hume
bequeaths £100 for building a bridge over this brook, but upon the
express condition that none of the stones for that purpose shall be
taken from a quarry in the neighbourhood, which forms part of a romantic
scene, in which, in his earlier days, Mr. Hume took particular delight."
This is the only authenticated instance that I remember to have met with
of Hume's attachment to local scenery. It is a tradition in Edinburgh,
that he was fond of walking along the base of Salisbury Crags.</p>

persisted in spelling his friend's name thus. To commemorate this
dispute, and Home's dislike of port wine, he added this codicil to his
will on 7th August:&mdash;</p>

<p>"I leave to my friend Mr. John Home of Kilduff, ten dozen of my old
claret, at his choice; and one single bottle of that other liquor called
port. I also leave to him six dozen of port, provided that he attests
under his hand, signed John <em>Hume</em>, that he has himself alone finished
that bottle at two sittings. By this concession, he will at once
terminate the only two differences that ever arose between us concerning
temporal matters." The original is in the MSS. R.S.E.</p>

shall die soon, which was no disagreeable news to me. He says I shall
die of weakness and inanition, and perhaps give little or no warning.
But though I be growing sensibly weaker every day, this period seems not
to be approaching; and I shall have time enough to inform you, and to
desire your company, which will be very agreeable to me. But at this
time your presence is necessary at Ninewells, to settle Josey, and
comfort his mother. Davie will be also very useful with you. I am much
pleased with his tenderness and friendship. I beg, therefore, that
neither you nor he may set out; and as the communication between us is

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">William Strahan</span> <i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Hume</span>.</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear Sir</span>,&mdash;Last Friday I received your affectionate
farewell, and therefore melancholy letter, which disabled me
from sending an immediate answer to it, as I now do, in hopes
this may yet find you, not much oppressed with pain, in the
land of the living. I need not tell you, that your corrections
are all duly attended to, as every particular shall be that
you desire or order. Nor shall I now trouble you with a long
letter.</p>

<p>"Only permit me to ask you a question or two, to which I am
prompted, you will believe me, not from a foolish or fruitless
curiosity, but from an earnest desire to learn the sentiments
of a man, who had spent a long life in philosophic inquiries,
and who, upon the extreme verge of it, seems, even in that
awful and critical period, to possess all the powers of his
mind in their full vigour, and in unabated tranquillity.</p>

<p>"I am more particularly led to give you this trouble, from a
passage in one of your late letters, wherein you say, <em>It is
an idle thing in us to be concerned about any thing that shall
happen after our death; yet this</em>, you added, <em>is natural to
all men</em>. Now I would eagerly ask, if it is <em>natural to all
men</em>, to be interested in futurity, does not this strongly
indicate that our existence will be protracted beyond this
life?</p>

<p>"Do you <em>now</em> believe, or suspect, that all the powers and
faculties of your own mind, which you have cultivated with so
much care and success, will cease and be extinguished with
your vital breath?</p>

<p>"Our soul, or immaterial part of us, some say, is able, when
on the brink of dissolution, to take a glimpse of futurity;
and for that reason I earnestly wish to have your <em>last
thoughts</em> on this important subject.</p>

<p>"I know you will kindly excuse this singular application; and
believe that I wish you, living or dying, every happiness that
our nature is capable of enjoying, either here or hereafter;
being, with the most sincere esteem and affection, my dear
sir, faithfully yours."&mdash;MS. R.S.E.</p>

<p class="dateline">"London, <i>August 19, 1776</i>."</p>
</div>

<p>This letter, if it ever reached him for whom it was designed, must have
done so too late to receive an answer. But if he did peruse it, with his
mind so collected and clear, yet so close on the point of being severed
from those objects of literary ambition which had been its chief glory
and occupation, how valuable would have been the first thought that
passed across it, when the great question was brought thus so distinctly
before his understanding!</p>

David Hume, Esq." there is the following curious statement.</p>

<p>"The anxious attention with which the public viewed every circumstance
respecting Mr. Hume's illness was not terminated even by his death. From
the busy curiosity of the mob, one would have presumed them to entertain
notions that the ashes of Mr. Hume were to have been the cause or the
object of miraculous exertion. As the physicians of London and Edinburgh
were divided about the seat of his disorder, those of the city where he
died proposed that his body should be opened; but this his brother, who
was also his executor, agreeably to the orders of the deceased, would
not permit. It is hardly to be credited that the grave-diggers, digging
with pick-axes Mr. Hume's grave, should have attracted the gaping
curiosity of the multitude; that, notwithstanding a heavy rain which
fell during the interment, multitudes of all ranks gazed on the funeral
procession, as if they had expected the hearse to have been consumed in
livid flames, or encircled with a ray of glory; that people in a sphere
much above the rabble would have sent to the sexton for the keys of the
burying-ground, and paid him to have access to visit the grave. And that
on a Sunday evening, (the gates of the burying-ground being opened for
another funeral,) the company from a public walk in the neighbourhood
flocked in such crowds to Mr. Hume's grave, that his brother actually
became apprehensive upon the unusual concourse, and ordered the grave to
be railed in with all expedition."</p>

Dès que le philosophe Allemand est tenté de faire un pas en arrière,

    <div class="line">Il murit, à Moka, dans le sable Arabique,</div>

</div>

<p>But the policy of the earth's distribution, with many other truths not
to be at once penetrated, even by the keenest mortal vision, were
mysteries to the auto-theist, and being so, were therefore to his
self-sufficient wisdom, absurd and ludicrous. Could that be right of
which the sage of Ferney could not understand the ruling principle!</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>"It may be right to explain, that the two sizes of type, used
in this work, were first adopted with the design of presenting
all letters addressed to Hume, all extracts, and all letters
from him with which the public is already familiar, in the
smaller type, in order that the reader coming to a document
with which he is already acquainted, might see at once where
it ends. This arrangement was accidentally broken through,
several letters having been printed in the larger that should
have appeared in the smaller type."[A]</p>
